But there is no good scientific evidence to support any uses.\\n\\nAbscess root is also called \"false Jacob\\'s ladder,\" because it has some of the same effects as another plant called Jacob\\'s ladder.

Phenethylamine is found in Acacia rigidula naturally, but the amounts found in supplements is often greater than would be expected.\\n\\nPeople use Acacia rigidula for athletic performance, obesity, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.\\n\\nMany supplements listing Acacia rigidula have been found to contain an amphetamine-like chemical called called beta-methylphenethylamine (BMPEA). It is not found naturally in Acacia rigidula or any other known plants. Any dietary supplement products containing BMPEA are considered misbranded by the US FDA.

Acai berries are believed to have more antioxidant content than cranberry, raspberry, blackberry, strawberry, or blueberry. Chemicals in acai might also reduce swelling, lower blood sugar levels, and stimulate the immune system.\\n\\nPeople commonly use acai for athletic performance, high cholesterol, erectile dysfunction (ED), obesity, aging skin, metabolic syndrome, and many other conditions. But there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.'},\n",

It's native to Central America, northern South America, Mexico, and the Caribbean.\\n\\nAcerola is commonly used to prevent vitamin C deficiency.

It's not clear if the effects of acetyl-L-carnitine are from the chemical itself, from the L-carnitine it can make, or from some other chemical.\\n\\nAcetyl-L-carnitine is sometimes used for Alzheimer disease, improving memory and thinking skills, treating symptoms of depression, and reducing nerve pain in people with diabetes. It is used for many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses.\"},\n",

This process causes the charcoal to develop lots of internal spaces or pores. These pores help activated charcoal trap chemicals.\\n\\nActivated charcoal is commonly used to treat poisoning. It is also used for high cholesterol, hangovers, and upset stomach, but there is no strong scientific evidence to support most of these uses.'},\n",

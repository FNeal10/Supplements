Caffeine,Likely Effective for,Mental alertness. Taking caffeine by mouth improves mental alertness. But it might not be as effective as getting enough sleep.
Caffeine,Possibly Effective for,"Athletic performance. Taking caffeine by mouth seems to increase physical strength and endurance and might delay fatigue during exercise. But taking more than 800 mg of caffeine daily (6-8 cups) can lead to caffeine levels greater than those allowed by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). A lung disease that affects newborns (bronchopulmonary dysplasia). Giving caffeine by mouth or by IV to premature infants seems to reduce the risk for this lung problem. IV products can only be given by a healthcare provider. Diabetes. Drinking beverages that contain caffeine is linked with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes. But it's not clear if consuming caffeine helps to treat diabetes. Memory. Taking caffeine by mouth seems to improve short-term memory in college students or people with outgoing personalities. Obesity. Taking caffeine by mouth together with ephedrine seems to increase weight loss, short-term. But there can be unwanted side effects. Even in carefully monitored and otherwise healthy adults, caffeine/ephedra combinations can cause changes in blood pressure and heart rate. Acute pain. Taking caffeine by mouth together with painkillers such as ibuprofen can reduce pain more than painkillers alone. Headache after epidural anesthesia, spinal anesthesia, or lumbar puncture.

Calcium,Likely Effective for,"Bone loss in people taking drugs called corticosteroids. Taking calcium and vitamin D by mouth seems to reduce bone density loss in people using corticosteroid drugs long-term. Overactive parathyroid (hyperparathyroidism). Taking calcium by mouth reduces parathyroid hormone levels in people with kidney failure and parathyroid hormone levels that are too high. Weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis). Consuming adequate amounts of calcium, both from the diet and supplements, is effective for preventing bone loss and treating osteoporosis. Taking calcium by mouth, alone or with vitamin D, also helps prevent fractures in people with osteoporosis. Premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Consuming adequate amounts of calcium, both from the diet and supplements, seems to significantly reduce mood swings, bloating, food cravings, and pain."
Calcium,Possibly Effective for,"Colon cancer, rectal cancer. Taking calcium supplements by mouth or increasing intake from the diet seems to reduces the risk of colorectal cancer. But people with low levels of vitamin D don't seem to benefit from calcium supplements, nor do people who are overweight or obese. Increasing bone strength in the unborn baby. Taking calcium supplements by mouth during pregnancy increases the bone mineral density of the baby when calcium intake from the diet is low. High blood pressure. Taking calcium supplements by mouth seems to reduce blood pressure by a small amount in people with or without high blood pressure. Softening of the bones (osteomalacia). Taking calcium by mouth seems to help reverse softening of the bones caused by very low calcium intake. A pregnancy complication marked by high blood pressure and protein in the urine (pre-eclampsia).

Cananga Oil,,
Candlenut,,
Cannabichromene (Cbc),,
Cannabidiol (Cbd),Likely Effective for,"Seizure disorder (epilepsy). A specific prescription product (Epidiolex, GW Pharmaceuticals) is approved by the US FDA to treat seizures caused by Dravet syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, or tuberous sclerosis complex. It is unclear if other forms of CBD are helpful for seizure. For now, stick with the prescription product."
Cannabidiol (Cbd),Possibly Effective for,"Multiple sclerosis (MS). A prescription-only nasal spray product (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals) containing both 9-delta-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol has been shown to be effective for improving pain, muscle-tightness, and urination frequency in people with MS. This product is used in over 25 countries outside of the United States. But there is inconsistent evidence on the effectiveness of cannabidiol for symptoms of multiple sclerosis when it is used alone. Some early research suggests that using a cannabidiol spray under the tongue might improve pain and muscle tightness, but not muscle spasms, tiredness, bladder control, mobility, or well-being and quality of life in patients with MS."
Cannabidivarin (Cbdv),Possibly Ineffective for,Seizure disorder (epilepsy). Taking cannabidivarin for 2 weeks doesn't appear to reduce seizures in people with poorly controlled seizure disorder.
Cannabigerol (Cbg),,
Cannabinol (Cbn),,
Cannabis,Possibly Effective for,"Multiple sclerosis (MS). Spraying a cannabis extract spray (Sativex) under the tongue seems to improve symptoms of MS such as muscle spasms and nerve pain. This product is not available in the US. In the UK and Canada, this product is a prescription drug. Nerve pain. Smoking cannabis seems to moderately reduce nerve pain caused by HIV and other conditions. The pain relief lasts for about 2 hours."
Canola Oil,Possibly Effective for,"Heart disease. There is some evidence that using canola oil in place of dietary fats with higher amounts of saturated fat might reduce the risk of heart disease. The suggested amount of canola oil is about 20 grams (1.5 tbsp) per day in place of other fats and oils. High cholesterol. Replacing other dietary fats with canola oil seems to slightly lower levels of cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL or ""bad"") cholesterol in people with high cholesterol and those at risk for heart disease. Some types of canola oil are modified to contain high amounts of oleic acid or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). These types of canola oil might have a greater effect on LDL cholesterol than regular canola oil."
Canola Oil,Possibly Ineffective for,"Obesity. Although not all research agrees, most research shows that taking canola oil doesn't greatly reduce body weight. It also doesn't seem to reduce fat."
Canola Oil,Insufficient Evidence for,"Diabetes. Early research shows that including canola oil as part of a low glycemic load diet helps to control blood sugar better than a whole-grain diet in people with diabetes who are already taking antidiabetes drugs. Other early research shows that taking canola oil reduces levels of LDL cholesterol in middle-aged women with diabetes. But it does not work as well as rice bran oil. Inherited tendency towards high cholesterol (familial hypercholesterolemia). Early research shows that using canola oil as the only source of fat as part of a low-fat diet helps to reduce levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL or ""bad"") cholesterol in children with inherited high cholesterol. But using sunflower oil as the only source of dietary fat seems to work just as well. High blood pressure. Early research shows that using canola oil that contains docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) helps lower blood pressure in people with large waists and risk factors for heart disease. But it seems that it is the DHA in the canola oil is what causes this improvement. Using canola oil without DHA does not seem to lower blood pressure. A grouping of symptoms that increase the risk of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke (metabolic syndrome). Early research shows that using canola oil instead of butter helps lower levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL or ""bad"") cholesterol in men with metabolic syndrome. But using canola oil doesn't seem to lower blood pressure, triglycerides, or blood sugar. It also doesn't seem to increase levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL or ""good"") cholesterol. Build up of fat in the liver in people who drink little or no alcohol (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or NAFLD). Early research shows that cooking with canola oil may help reduce the severity of NAFLD compared to cooking with soybean/safflower oil. Other conditions."
Canthaxanthin,Possibly Effective for,"An inherited disorder marked by sensitivity to light (erythropoietic protoporphyria or EPP). Taking canthaxanthin by mouth, with or without beta-carotene, seems to reduce rash, itching, or eczema caused by sensitivity to sunlight exposure in people with EPP."

Capsicum,Likely Effective for,"Nerve pain in people with diabetes (diabetic neuropathy). A specific cream containing 0.075% capsaicin (Zostrix-HP, Link Medical Products Pty Ltd.) 4 times daily is approved for treating this condition. Another patch containing 8% capsaicin (Qutenza, NeurogesX, Inc.), which is available by prescription only, is also approved for treating this condition. Creams or gels that contain smaller amounts of capsaicin (less than 0.075%) don't seem to work. Chronic pain. Applying creams and lotions containing capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, can temporarily relieve chronic pain from several conditions. It's FDA approved for this use. Nerve damage caused by shingles (postherpetic neuralgia). Applying a patch containing 8% capsaicin (Qutenza, NeurogesX Inc.), the active chemical in capsicum, reduces pain over 24 hours in people with this condition. This capsaicin patch is available by prescription only."
Capsicum,Possibly Effective for,"Back pain. Applying capsicum or capsaicin to the skin seems to help reduce back pain. Cluster headache. Applying capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, inside the nose can reduce the number and severity of cluster headaches. It's not clear if it helps treat cluster headaches. Runny nose not caused by allergies or infection (nonallergic rhinitis). Applying capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, inside the nose can reduce runny nose in people who do not have allergies or an infection. The benefits might last for 6-9 months. Osteoarthritis. Applying 0.025% capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, to the skin can improve symptoms of osteoarthritis. Acute pain. Applying capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, to the skin can reduce pain from trauma. Nausea and vomiting after surgery.

Carob,Possibly Effective for,"Diarrhea. Drinking juice from raw carob bean or taking carob pod powder by mouth before taking standard oral rehydration solution (ORS) seems to reduce how long diarrhea lasts in children and infants. High cholesterol. Taking carob by mouth seems to reduces total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL or ""bad"") cholesterol in people with moderately high cholesterol."
Carqueja,Insufficient Evidence for,"Pain. Indigestion. Water retention. Constipation. Protecting the liver. Diabetes. Chest pain (angina). Improving circulation. Intestinal worms. Wounds, when applied to the skin. Other conditions."
Carrageenan,Possibly Ineffective for,A sexually transmitted infection that can lead to genital warts or cancer (human papillomavirus or HPV). Applying a carrageen gel before intercourse does not reduce the risk of anal HPV in males who have sex with males.
Carrot,Possibly Effective for,Vitamin A deficiency. Some early research shows that eating carrot jam for 10 weeks improves growth rate in children with vitamin A deficiency. Other early research shows that eating grated carrot for 60 days improves vitamin A levels in some pregnant women who are at risk for not having enough vitamin A.
Cascara Sagrada,Possibly Ineffective for,"Emptying the colon before a colonoscopy. Taking cascara sagrada by mouth, along with magnesium sulfate or milk of magnesia, does not improve bowel cleansing in people who are having a colonoscopy."
Cascarilla,Insufficient Evidence for,Digestive disorders. Diarrhea. Vomiting. Other conditions.
Casein Peptides,Likely Effective for,"Eczema (atopic dermatitis). Feeding infants formula containing casein peptides with or without breastmilk for up to 6 months reduces the chances of getting eczema. Prone to allergies and allergic reactions (atopic disease). Feeding infants formula containing casein peptides instead of cow's milk reduces the risk for allergies in infants with a family history of allergic conditions. But it's not clear if it benefits infants without a family history of allergic conditions. Food allergies. Some formulas containing casein peptides are safe and do not cause allergic reactions in children who have an allergic reaction to cow's milk. These formulas include Alimentum, Damira 2000, Frisolac Allergycare, and Nutramigen."
Casein Peptides,Possibly Effective for,"Excessive crying in infants (colic). Feeding infants with colic a formula containing casein peptides reduces crying short-term. Diabetes. Eating casein peptides with carbohydrates might improve insulin and glucose levels after a meal in people with type 2 diabetes. It's not clear if casein peptides reduce the risk for type 1 diabetes in infants. High blood pressure. Taking certain casein peptides, sometimes called lactotripeptides, seem to lower blood pressure by a small amount in people with high blood pressure. High levels of a chemical called bilirubin in the blood of newborns (neonatal jaundice). Feeding infants formula containing casein peptides instead of a formula containing whey protein or breastmilk seems to reduce the risk of jaundice in newborns."
Casein Peptides,Possibly Ineffective for,"Asthma. Feeding infants formula containing casein peptides, with or without breastmilk, doesn't reduce the risk of asthma in infants. Infant development. Feeding premature, low-birth weight, or healthy infants a formula containing casein peptides does not increase or decrease growth when compared with breast milk or other formulas."
Casein Protein,Possibly Ineffective for,"Infant development. Most research shows that feeding premature, low-birth weight, and healthy infants a formula containing casein protein does not increase or decrease growth compared to breast milk, whey protein-based formula, rice hydrolysate formula, cow's milk formula, or amino acid-based formula."
Casein Protein,Insufficient Evidence for,"Liver disease in people who drink alcohol. Early research shows that administering a casein protein supplement through a feeding tube for 28 days improves mental status in patients who have liver disease from alcohol consumption. Other early research shows that taking a casein-based formula daily for one year lowers the risk for hospitalization and infection in these patients. But casein protein does not seem to reduce the risk of death. Athletic performance. Some early research shows that taking casein protein before or after exercise improves strength and athletic performance. But not all research agrees. Some research also shows that casein protein works just as well as whey protein or creatine for improving athletic performance. But other research shows that whey protein is better than casein protein. Cirrhosis. Early research shows that drinking a casein protein supplement for 4-6 days improves mental status in people with cirrhosis. A lung disease that makes it harder to breathe (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD). People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often lose muscle function over time. Some studies show that taking casein protein along with exercise builds muscle. But early research shows that taking casein protein daily for 8 weeks does not improve lung or muscle function in people with COPD. Diabetes. Limited research suggests that taking casein protein with food might increase insulin, but not blood sugar levels, in people with diabetes. Diarrhea. Early research in infants with the stomach flu shows that using a formula containing casein protein, instead of cow's milk, reduces diarrhea. Muscle soreness after exercise. Early research in strength training athletes shows that taking a specific protein supplement containing casein protein and other ingredients before and after exercise does not reduce muscle soreness. Persistent heartburn. Early research in children with brain damage shows that a formula containing casein protein doesn't work as well as whey protein formula for reducing symptoms of heartburn. But casein protein and whey protein seem to have similar effects in infants with heartburn. Reduced brain function in people with advanced liver disease (hepatic encephalopathy). Early research shows that taking casein protein for 3 months does not improve mental function in people with chronic liver disease. Swelling (inflammation) of the liver caused by the hepatitis C virus (hepatitis C). Early research shows that taking casein protein daily for 12 weeks improves quality of life in people with hepatitis C infection. High levels of cholesterol or other fats (lipids) in the blood (hyperlipidemia). Most research shows that casein protein does not improve ""good"" or ""bad"" cholesterol levels in people with normal cholesterol or in people with high cholesterol. But some small studies show that it might improve these levels in some people. Also, eating casein protein seems to lower the levels of a certain type of cholesterol called lipoprotein(a). High blood pressure. The effect of casein protein on blood pressure is unclear. Some research shows that it can reduce systolic blood pressure (the top number), while other research shows that it can reduce diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number). Obesity. Most research shows that taking casein protein does not reduce body weight or appetite in people who are overweight or obese. But some early research shows that having a liquid snack containing casein protein reduces hunger in overweight patients. Also, early research shows that taking casein protein for 12 weeks prevents weight gain in obese people who have already lost weight. In overweight children, early research shows that drinking a milk drink containing casein protein daily for 12 weeks instead of water increases body weight. Other conditions."
Cashew,,
Cassava,Insufficient Evidence for,"Diabetes. People who eat more cassava flour as part of their diet seem to have a lower risk for developing diabetes. Dehydration in people with diarrhea. Cassava salt solutions can be taken by children by mouth to treat mild to moderate dehydration caused by diarrhea. However, severe dehydration due to diarrhea causes low levels of electrolytes. Cassava salt solutions do not contain a significant amount of electrolytes. Therefore, these solutions do not seem suitable for treating severe dehydration due to diarrhea. Fatigue. Sepsis.

Early research found that heart failure might be linked with low coenzyme Q10 levels. Some research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 might help reduce some symptoms of heart failure. Coenzyme Q10 might also reduce the chances of death or hospitalization related to heart failure. Nerve pain in people with diabetes (diabetic neuropathy). Research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 improves nerve damage and nerve pain in people with nerve damage caused by diabetes. Fibromyalgia. Some research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 by mouth reduces pain, tenderness, fatigue, and sleep issues in people with fibromyalgia. Tissue damage caused when there is limited blood flow and then blood flow is restored (ischemia-reperfusion injury). Reduced blood supply during heart or blood vessel surgery can deprive tissue of oxygen. When blood supply returns to this tissue, the tissue can become damaged.

Some early research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 by mouth might reduce chest pain and improve exercise ability in people with chest pain. Heart damage caused by certain cancer drugs (anthracycline cardiotoxicity). Early research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 by mouth might protect the heart in children aged 3-12 years who are being treated with a class of drugs called anthracyclines. But results from larger studies are inconsistent. Autism. Early research shows that taking a specific form of coenzyme Q10 called ubiquinol improves autism symptoms in autism patients aged 3-6 years according to parent assessment. Higher quality studies are needed to confirm these results. Bipolar disorder. Early research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 improves symptoms of depression in people over 55 years of age with bipolar disorder. Breast cancer. Some research in Chinese women suggests that having low blood levels of coenzyme Q10 is linked to an increased risk of breast cancer. Cancer. Low coenzyme Q10 levels seem to be linked with an increased risk of skin cancer. Early research suggests that taking coenzyme Q10 along with other antioxidants increases survival time by 40% in patients with terminal cancer. Higher quality studies are needed to confirm these results. Brain damage that affects muscle movement (cerebellar ataxia).

One study shows it might lower triglycerides and LDL (or ""bad"" cholesterol) by a small amount. Other studies show no benefit of taking coenzyme Q10 for lowering total cholesterol or LDL or increasing HDL (or ""good"" cholesterol) levels. It may take at least 3 months to see any benefit. High blood pressure. Some research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 by itself or along with other medications for treating high blood pressure helps lowers blood pressure in people with high blood pressure. However, not all research has shown benefit. Coenzyme Q10 might only benefit people with high blood pressure who also have diabetes or low blood levels of coenzyme Q10 before treatment. Taking coenzyme Q10 by mouth daily appears to lower systolic blood pressure (the top number) in some people with high systolic blood pressure but normal diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number).

Early research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 can improve markers of liver injury and disease severity in people with NAFLD. Obesity. Taking coenzyme Q10 does not seem to help with weight loss. Parkinson disease. Some research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 by itself or along with other supplements might slow mental decline in people with early-stage Parkinson disease. At least 16 months of treatment and doses above 600 mg daily appear to be needed to achieve these benefits. However, not all data has been positive. Some research shows that coenzyme Q10 does not benefit people with early or mid-stage Parkinson disease. A serious gum infection (periodontitis). Applying coenzyme Q10 to the gums is not effective for treating gum disease. However, there is some early evidence that taking coenzyme Q10 by mouth might be helpful. A hormonal disorder that causes enlarged ovaries with cysts (polycystic ovary syndrome or PCOS). Early research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 can reduce hair loss and acne in women with PCOS. It might also reduce blood sugar levels and cholesterol levels. A rare inherited disorder that causes obesity, short stature, and learning disability (Prader-Willi syndrome or PWS). Early research suggests that taking coenzyme Q10 improves mental and physical development in children with PWS. But it is not clear if these improvements are due to the coenzyme Q10 or an age-related phenomenon. A pregnancy complication marked by high blood pressure and protein in the urine (pre-eclampsia). Pre-eclampsia is a condition that some women develop during pregnancy. Some research shows that women who are at risk have a lower chance of developing the condition if they take coenzyme Q10 from week 20 of pregnancy until the baby is delivered. Schizophrenia. It is unclear if taking coenzyme Q10 improves symptoms in people with schizophrenia. Blood infection (sepsis). Some early research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 might prevent death in people with blood infections. But other research shows that taking a form of coenzyme Q10 called ubiquinol doesn't prevent death. Coenzyme Q10 doesn't seem to reduce time in the hospital due to a blood infection. Muscle pain caused by statin drugs (statin-induced myalgia). Statins, a class of drugs used to lower cholesterol, can sometimes cause muscle pain. There is some evidence that taking coenzyme Q10 might reduce this pain. But not all research agrees. Muscle weakness caused by statin drugs (statin-induced myopathy). Statins, a class of drugs used to lower cholesterol, can sometimes cause muscle weakness. There is some evidence that taking coenzyme Q10 might improve this weakness. But not all research agrees.

When factors such as age and sun exposure are taken into account, drinking coffee doesn't seem to be linked with a lower chance of developing skin cancer. Build up of fat in the liver in people who drink little or no alcohol (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or NAFLD). It's unclear if drinking coffee reduces the risk of NAFLD. Nonmelanoma skin cancer. Some research shows that drinking many cups of coffee per day might reduce the risk of a specific form of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma. But drinking decaffeinated coffee does not seem to have any effect on skin cancer risk. Obesity. The effect of coffee on weight loss in people who are overweight or obese is unclear. Results from research are conflicting. Some research suggests that taking coffee chemicals, called mannooligosaccharides, for 12 weeks might help with weight loss in men, but not women. Drinking a dark roast coffee seems to help reduce food intake and help with weight loss, whereas a light roast coffee does not. Other research suggests that drinking coffee with or without caffeine does not help with weight loss. Mouth cancer. People who drink more coffee don't seem to have a lower risk of mouth cancer. Ovarian cancer. Drinking coffee doesn't seem to change a person's risk for ovarian cancer. Swelling (inflammation) of the pancreas (pancreatitis).

Kidney, bladder, or gallbladder stones. Treating sore mouth and throat. Other conditions."
Hercules Club,,
Hesperidin,Possibly Effective for,"Poor circulation that can cause the legs to swell (chronic venous insufficiency or CVI). Taking a particular product containing hesperidin methyl chalcone, butcher's broom, and vitamin C by mouth seems to relieve the symptoms of poor circulation in the legs. Also, taking a different product containing hesperidin and diosmin by mouth for 2-6 months seems to improve CVI symptoms, although taking the drug Venoruton might be more effective for treating this condition. Hemorrhoids. Some research suggests that taking hesperidin and diosmin improves symptoms of anal hemorrhoids. It may also prevent hemorrhoids from coming back after they have healed and may help in an emergency worsening of hemorrhoids. Leg sores caused by weak blood circulation (venous leg ulcer).

Idebenone appears most effective in patients with moderately severe Alzheimer disease. An inherited condition that causes vision loss (Leber hereditary optic neuropathy). Taking idebenone seems to improve vision in people who have had this condition for less than a year. There's not enough information to know if starting idebenone improves vision in people who were diagnosed with this condition more than 1 year ago. A group of inherited disorders that cause muscle weakness and muscle loss (muscular dystrophy). There is some evidence that taking idebenone improves airway function, prevents airway infections, and slows long-term loss of airway function in children and teens with a specific type of muscular dystrophy, called Duchenne muscular dystrophy. But it doesn't seem to benefit people with this condition who are already being treated with steroids."

Taking inositol by mouth doesn't improve symptoms of depression. Nerve pain in people with diabetes (diabetic neuropathy). Taking inositol by mouth doesn't seem to improve the symptoms of nerve pain caused by diabetes. An eye disorder in premature infants that can lead to blindness (retinopathy of prematurity). Giving myo-inositol by IV or by mouth to premature babies doesn't seem to lower the chance of developing retinopathy. In fact, it might increase the risk of death. IV products can only be given by a healthcare provider."
Inositol Nicotinate,Possibly Effective for,Painful response to cold especially in the fingers and toes (Raynaud syndrome). Some research shows that taking a specific product of inositol nicotinate (Hexopal) by mouth for several weeks modestly improves symptoms of Raynaud syndrome.
Inositol Nicotinate,Insufficient Evidence for,High levels of cholesterol or other fats (lipids) in the blood (hyperlipidemia). The effectiveness of inositol nicotinate for treating high cholesterol is unclear. Some research shows that inositol nicotinate can decrease cholesterol levels. But other research shows that inositol nicotinate does not have an effect. Leg pain during exercise due to poor blood flow (intermittent claudication).

But it might not reduce discomfort. Diabetes. Taking inulin by mouth along with antidiabetes drugs might improve blood sugar levels in some people with diabetes, short-term. But it's not clear if it helps long-term. Obesity. Taking inulin by mouth might increase short-term weight loss. But it's not clear if it helps with long-term weight loss or weight maintenance in people who are overweight or obese."
Iodine,Likely Effective for,"Iodine deficiency. Taking iodine supplements by mouth, including iodized salt, is effective for preventing and treating iodine deficiency. Radiation exposure. Taking iodine by mouth can protect the thyroid after exposure in a radiation emergency. But it should not be used for general protection against radiation."
Iodine,Possibly Effective for,"Pink eye. Using eye drops containing iodine in the form of povidone-iodine seems to reduce the risk of pink eye in newborns. It also seems to help treat pink eye in adults. Foot sores in people with diabetes. Applying iodine to foot sores might help treat foot ulcers related to diabetes. Swelling (inflammation) of the lining of the uterus (endometritis). Washing the vagina with a solution containing iodine in the form of povidone-iodine before a cesarean delivery reduces the risk of swelling of the uterus lining. A type of benign (non-cancerous) breast disease (fibrocystic breast disease). Taking molecular iodine, in a dose of about 3000-6000 mcg daily, reduces breast tenderness and pain. Lower doses of 1500 mcg daily don't seem to help. Swelling (inflammation) and sores inside the mouth (oral mucositis). Rinsing the mouth with an iodine solution seems to prevent soreness and swelling inside the mouth caused by chemotherapy. A serious gum infection (periodontitis). Rinsing the mouth with an iodine solution during non-surgical treatments for gum infections can help reduce the depth of infected gum pockets. Infection after surgery. Applying iodine in the form of povidone-iodine before or during surgery reduces the risk of infections. But it's unclear how it compares to other options, such as chlorhexidine, for preventing infections. A life-threatening condition caused by excess of thyroid hormone (thyroid storm). Taking iodine by mouth in combination with other treatments can help treat thyroid storm. Lumps in the thyroid. Taking iodine by mouth can improve lumps on the thyroid called thyroid nodules. Leg sores caused by weak blood circulation (venous leg ulcer). Applying cadexomer iodine to the skin might help leg ulcers heal. But it's unclear if applying povidone-iodine helps."
Iodine,Possibly Ineffective for,Infections in people with catheters. Applying povidone-iodine where a dialysis catheter is inserted doesn't seem to work as well as chlorhexidine for reducing the risk of a blood infection. Applying povidone-iodine before inserting a urinary catheter doesn't reduce the risk for infection. Growth and development in premature infants. Feeding premature infants iodine supplements doesn't improve their brain development nor reduce their risk of dying.
Ip-6,,
Ipecac,Possibly Ineffective for,"Poisoning. In the past, ipecac syrup was commonly used to cause vomiting in people who ingested poison. But now it is no longer recommended.

It is not yet clear whether magnesium helps reduce irregular heartbeat after heart surgery. Asthma. Giving magnesium intravenously (by IV) seems to help treat sudden asthma attacks. It might be more beneficial in children than in adults. But inhaling magnesium or taking magnesium by mouth doesn't seem to work. Colon cancer, rectal cancer. Research shows that eating more foods with magnesium in them is linked to a reduced risk of colon and rectal cancer. But other research suggests that magnesium might reduce colon cancer risk, but not rectal cancer risk. Diabetes. Eating a diet with more magnesium is linked with a reduced risk of developing diabetes in adults and overweight children. Research in people existing type 2 diabetes is conflicting. However, magnesium supplements might be most helpful in people with type 2 diabetes and low magnesium levels. In people who developed diabetes during pregnancy, taking magnesium seems to improve sensitivity to insulin and reduce the levels of sugar in the blood. High cholesterol. Taking magnesium chloride and magnesium oxide appears to slightly decrease low-density lipoprotein (LDL or ""bad"") and total cholesterol levels, and slightly increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL or ""good"") cholesterol levels in people with high cholesterol. There is also some evidence that magnesium might lower blood fats called triglycerides in people with high triglyceride levels. A grouping of symptoms that increase the risk of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke (metabolic syndrome). People with low magnesium levels are 6-7 times more likely to have metabolic syndrome than people with normal magnesium levels. Higher magnesium intake from diet and supplements is linked with a lower risk of developing metabolic syndrome in healthy adults. Weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis). Taking magnesium by mouth seems to prevent bone loss in older females with osteoporosis. Pain after surgery. When administered with anesthesia or given to people after surgery, magnesium seems to increase the amount of time before pain develops and might decrease the need to use pain relievers after surgery. Giving magnesium intravenously (by IV) seems to help reduce pain after a surgical procedure to remove the uterus called a hysterectomy. But magnesium does not seem to help reduce pain in children after tonsil removal. Premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Taking magnesium by mouth seems to relieve symptoms of PMS, including mood changes and bloating. Taking magnesium by mouth also seems to prevent premenstrual migraines. Chest pain due to blood vessel spasms (vasospastic angina).

It's not clear if taking magnesium by mouth is helpful in people with a concussion.
Magnesium,Insufficient Evidence for,"Alcohol use disorder. Taking magnesium by mouth seems to improve sleep quality in people who are dependent on alcohol and going through withdrawal. However, injecting magnesium as a shot does not seem to reduce alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Children with ADHD seem to have lower magnesium levels. Early research suggests that magnesium might be helpful for children with ADHD who have low magnesium levels. Back pain. Early research suggests that receiving magnesium intravenously (by IV) every 4 hours for 2 weeks while taking magnesium by mouth daily for 4 weeks reduces pain in people with chronic low back pain. Bipolar disorder. Early research suggests that taking a certain magnesium product (Magnesiocard) may have similar effects as lithium in some people with bipolar disorder. Other early research suggests that taking magnesium by mouth along with the drug verapamil reduces manic symptoms better than verapamil alone in people with bipolar disorder. Also, giving magnesium intravenously (by IV) seems to reduce the dose of other drugs needed to manage severe manic symptoms. Nerve pain in people with cancer. Giving magnesium intravenously (by IV) seems to help relieve pain caused by nerve damage due to cancer. Damage to the immune system caused by cancer drug treatment. Early research shows that taking magnesium by mouth might prevent immune system damage in children receiving the cancer drug cisplatin. Sudden loss of heart function (cardiac arrest). Some preliminary research suggests that higher levels of magnesium are linked with a lower chance of cardiac arrest. However, it is not known if taking a magnesium supplement reduces the risk of cardiac arrest. Giving magnesium intravenously does not seem to have a benefit. Heart disease (cardiovascular disease). It is unclear if people who get more magnesium as part of their diet have a lower chance of heart disease. Some research has found that increasing magnesium intake in the diet is linked to a reduced risk of death related to heart disease. But other research has found no benefit. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Administering magnesium as a shot might improve symptoms of fatigue. But not all research agrees. A lung disease that makes it harder to breathe (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD). Administering magnesium intravenously (by IV) seems to help sudden COPD symptoms. Also, taking magnesium using an inhaler, along with the drug salbutamol, seems to reduce sudden COPD symptoms better than salbutamol alone. Cluster headache. Early research shows that giving magnesium intravenously (by IV) might relieve cluster headaches. Heart disease (coronary heart disease). Early research shows that taking magnesium by mouth might reduce blood clots in people with heart disease. Depression. It is unclear if people who get more magnesium as part of their diet have a lower chance of depression. It is also too early to know if magnesium can reduce symptoms in people with depression. Taking magnesium by mouth for 6 weeks seems to reduce mild to moderate depression in adults. But getting a single dose of magnesium intravenously (by IV) doesn't reduce depression symptoms when measured one week later. Confusion and agitation after surgery. Early research suggests that IV magnesium does not reduce confusion and agitation in children after surgery. Muscle soreness caused by exercise. Early research suggests that taking magnesium for 10 days might reduce muscle soreness after lifting weights. Fibromyalgia.

People who get more magnesium from their diet or as supplements seem to have a lower risk of fractures. Stomach cancer. People who get more magnesium from their diet or as supplements do not seem to have a lower risk of stomach cancer. Hearing loss. Taking magnesium by mouth seems to prevent hearing loss in people exposed to loud noise. Also, taking magnesium seems to improve hearing loss in people with sudden hearing loss that is not from loud noise. High blood pressure. Most research shows that taking magnesium can lower diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number in a blood pressure reading) by about 2 mmHg. This decrease might be too small to have a meaningful impact on high blood pressure. There's conflicting data about the effects of magnesium on systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading). Insomnia. Magnesium might reduce insomnia in the elderly. But it doesn't seem to improve sleep in people without insomnia. Bleeding into or around the fluid-filled areas (ventricles) of the brain (intraventricular hemorrhage). Early research suggests that premature infants might have a lower risk of a brain bleed if their mothers receive magnesium by IV while pregnant. Kidney stones. Some research shows that taking magnesium by mouth might prevent kidney stones in people who have had kidney stones. Liver cancer. People who get more magnesium from their diet seem to have a lower risk of liver cancer. Migraine. Taking high doses of magnesium by mouth might help prevent migraines and make them a little less severe. But not all research agrees. IV magnesium might relieve migraines in people that don't get enough magnesium in their diet. Heart attack. In general, giving magnesium intravenously (by IV) or taking magnesium by mouth does not seem to reduce the overall risk of death after a heart attack. Brain damage in infants caused by lack of oxygen. Research suggests that administering magnesium intravenously (by IV) might improve outcomes in infants with brain damage caused by lack of oxygen in the short-term. But it doesn't seem to have long-term benefit. Obesity. It is unclear if taking magnesium by mouth improves weight loss in obese people. If it does, any benefits are likely to be small. Death from any cause. Consuming more magnesium in the diet is linked to a lower risk of death. However, taking magnesium supplements does not seem to reduce this risk. Pain (chronic).

Some research shows that taking magnesium daily for 12 weeks might help elderly females to walk further. A hormonal disorder that causes enlarged ovaries with cysts (polycystic ovary syndrome or PCOS). Taking magnesium does not seem to reduce insulin resistance in PCOS. Leg cramps in women who are pregnant. Most research shows that taking magnesium by mouth might reduce leg cramps during pregnancy. But not all research agrees. Preterm birth. Giving magnesium intravenously (by IV) might prevent contractions when premature labor occurs. Some research suggests that magnesium is more effective at delaying labor by 48 hours compared to some conventional drugs. But not all experts believe it is beneficial, and some research suggests it might cause more adverse effects. A rare, inherited disorder that causes buildup of minerals in the skin, eyes, and blood vessels (Pseudoxanthoma elasticum or PXE). Early research suggests that magnesium supplementation might reduce buildup of minerals in people with PXE. A disorder that causes leg discomfort and an irresistible urge to move the legs (restless legs syndrome or RLS). Taking magnesium by mouth might decrease the amount of movement and increase the amount of sleep in patients with restless legs syndrome. However, the role of magnesium, if any, in restless legs syndrome is uncertain. Some people with this condition have high levels of magnesium in their blood, while others have low magnesium levels. Stroke. Most early research found that increased intake of magnesium in the diet is linked with a reduced risk of death from stroke. There is also some evidence that increased dietary intake of magnesium seems to improve mental ability in people after stroke. But the effects of intravenous (IV) magnesium are mixed. Some research shows that it might protect the brain after stroke. But other research shows that it does not reduce the risk of death or disability in most people. Bleeding in the space surrounding the brain (subarachnoid hemorrhage). There is mixed evidence about the effect of magnesium in managing bleeding in the brain. Some research suggests that giving magnesium intravenously (by IV) reduces the risk of death and vegetative state. However, other research does not support these findings. Allergic rhinitis.

In children receiving a medication called sevoflurane during surgery, taking melatonin by mouth before anesthesia might help to prevent anxiety and agitation while waking up. The effect of taking melatonin in adults undergoing surgery is unclear. High blood pressure. Taking the controlled-release form of melatonin by mouth before bedtime seems to lower blood pressure in people with high blood pressure. Immediate-release products don't seem to work. Insomnia. Taking melatonin by mouth, short-term, seems to shorten the time it takes to fall asleep in people with insomnia, but only by about 7-12 minutes. It's not clear if it affects the amount of time spent sleeping. It also seems to be more helpful in older adults and those with certain other conditions. Jet lag. Taking melatonin by mouth can improve certain symptoms of jet lag such as alertness and reduce daytime sleepiness and tiredness. But it might not help shorten the time it takes for people with jet lag to fall asleep. Migraine. Taking melatonin by mouth before bed can prevent migraines in adults and children.

Narrowing of blood vessels that causes poor blood flow to the limbs (peripheral arterial disease). Some research shows that taking mesoglycan by mouth alone or in combination with mesoglycan given as a shot seems to improve walking distance in patients with leg pain due to peripheral arterial disease. However, taking mesoglycan by mouth seems to be less effective for improving walking distance than taking the drug defibrotide. Poor circulation that can lead to varicose veins and other conditions (venous insufficiency).

Milk Thistle,Insufficient Evidence for,"Acne. Taking milk thistle might lessen acne severity. But the benefits, if any, are small. Liver disease in people who drink alcohol. There is conflicting evidence about the effectiveness of milk thistle for treating alcohol-related liver disease. Early research shows that taking milk thistle by mouth might improve liver function and reduce risk of death. However, other research shows no benefit. Mushroom poisoning. Early research shows that giving silibinin, a chemical found in milk thistle may lessen liver damage caused by Amanita phalloides mushroom (death cap mushroom) poisoning. However, it is hard to obtain silibinin in the US. A blood disorder that reduces levels of protein in the blood called hemoglobin (beta-thalassemia). Early research in children with this blood disorder shows that taking a specific milk thistle extract for 6-9 months, along with conventional medicine, might decrease iron levels better than conventional medicine alone. An adverse skin reaction caused by cancer drug treatment (chemotherapy-induced acral erythema). Early research shows that applying a gel containing milk thistle extract to the hands and feet beginning on the first day of chemotherapy and continuing for 9 weeks decreases the severity of this skin reaction caused by a cancer drug called capecitabine. Liver damage caused by cancer drugs. Early research shows that taking a specific milk thistle product containing the chemical silibinin beginning at the start of chemotherapy treatment does not significantly reduce liver toxicity caused by chemotherapy. Kidney damage caused by cancer drugs. Early research shows that taking milk thistle extract beginning 24-48 hours before starting therapy with cisplatin, and continuing until the end of the treatment course, does not prevent or decrease the rates of kidney injury. Liver scarring (cirrhosis). Early research shows that milk thistle extract might reduce the risk of death and improve liver function in people with cirrhosis. However, milk thistle extract does not seem to benefit all patients with liver disease. Kidney disease in people with diabetes (diabetic nephropathy). Early research shows that taking milk thistle extract together with conventional treatment might help treat kidney disease in people with diabetes. Hay fever. Some research shows that taking milk thistle extract by mouth along with the allergy medication cetirizine (Zyrtec) reduces seasonal allergies more than taking cetirizine alone. Swelling (inflammation) of the liver (hepatitis). Research on the effects of milk thistle in people with hepatitis is not consistent. Some research shows that taking milk thistle extract by mouth for 4 weeks reduces hepatitis symptoms, such as dark urine and jaundice, but does not improve liver function tests. But taking a product containing the milk thistle constituent silybin plus phosphatidylcholine by mouth for 2 weeks to 3 months might improve some liver function tests. Swelling (inflammation) of the liver caused by the hepatitis B virus (hepatitis B). Research on the effects of milk thistle in people with hepatitis B is not consistent. Early research shows that taking milk thistle extract by mouth for up to one year, or taking a product containing the milk thistle constituent silybin plus phosphatidylcholine by mouth for 1 week, improves liver function tests. But other research shows no benefit. Swelling (inflammation) of the liver caused by the hepatitis C virus (hepatitis C). Research on the effects of milk thistle in people with hepatitis C is inconsistent.

Early research suggests that milk thistle reduces menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes. Build-up of fat in the liver in people who drink little or no alcohol (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or NAFLD). There is evidence that milk thistle extract improves markers of liver injury in people with NAFLD. But these markers aren't always linked with the NAFLD severity. Most experts recommend that people with NAFLD lose weight to reduce fat build-up in the liver and lower their cholesterol to reduce the risk of heart disease. Taking milk thistle does not seem to improve either of these outcomes. Swelling (inflammation) and build up of fat in the liver in people who drink little or no alcohol (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH). While taking milk thistle doesn't seem to improve the overall severity of NASH, it may reduce scarring of the liver. A type of anxiety marked by recurrent thoughts and repetitive behaviors (obsessive-compulsive disorder or OCD). Early research shows that taking milk thistle leaf extract by mouth three times daily for 8 weeks has a limited effect on OCD symptoms.

Using cooking oils that provide about 20 grams (1.5 tablespoons) of oleic acid in place of dietary fats with higher amounts of saturated fat might reduce the risk of heart disease. But research is limited. High cholesterol. Using cooking oils rich in oleic acid might help lower cholesterol. These oils include olive oil, some sunflower oils, and canola oil."
Oleic Acid,Insufficient Evidence for,"Bladder cancer. People with higher blood levels of oleic acid seem to have a lower risk of bladder cancer. But the amount of oleic acid in the blood can be affected by more than just intake from foods. So, it's still unclear if increasing intake of oleic acid from food reduces bladder cancer risk. It's also unknown if oleic acid supplements can help prevent bladder cancer. Breast cancer. Eating more foods that contain oleic acid doesn't seem to prevent breast cancer. It's unknown if oleic acid supplements can help prevent bladder cancer. Diabetes. Following a low-fat diet that includes food with oleic acid doesn't seem to lower cholesterol in people with diabetes. Diarrhea.

Eating oil high in oleic acid might not help to lower high blood pressure. But more research is needed. Obesity. Some early research shows that using cooking oil containing oleic acid reduces fat around the abdomen by a small amount in people who are obese. It also seems to help to lower cholesterol in some people who are obese and at risk for heart disease. But using similar cooking oils without oleic acid also seem to have benefit. So, it's unclear if the oleic acid causes these improvements. Pancreatic cancer. People who get more oleic acid from their diet may have a lower risk of pancreatic cancer. But not all research agrees. Poor nutrient absorption that occurs when part of the small intestine is missing or removed (short bowel syndrome). Early research shows that taking oleic acid doesn't reduce diarrhea or help with nutrient absorption in people with short bowel syndrome. Stroke. People with higher blood levels of oleic acid seem to have a lower risk of stroke. But the amount of oleic acid in the blood can be affected by more than just intake from foods. So, it's still unclear if increasing intake of oleic acid from food reduces stroke risk. It's also unknown if oleic acid supplements can help prevent bladder cancer. A type of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis). People who get more oleic acid from their diet might have a lower risk of ulcerative colitis. But not all research agrees.

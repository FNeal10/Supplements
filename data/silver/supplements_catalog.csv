Bismuth,"Bismuth (Bi) is a chemical element with the atomic number 83. Bismuth supplements usually contain bismuth in a salt form, such as bismuth subsalicylate.

Bismuth salts seem to help eliminate bacteria that cause stomach problems such as diarrhea and stomach ulcers. Bismuth salts also work like an antacid to treat problems such as indigestion. Bismuth might also speed up blood clotting.

People commonly use bismuth for travelers' diarrhea, a digestive tract infection that can lead to ulcers (Helicobacter pylori or H. pylori), and stomach ulcers. It is also used for constipation, bleeding, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these other uses.

Bismuth supplements are available in many different salt forms. Bismuth nitrate is a specific form that is not legal for use in dietary supplements. Review the listing on bismuth nitrate for more details.","When taken by mouth: Bismuth subgallate and bismuth subsalicylate are likely safe for most people when used as directed. Other forms of bismuth salts are possibly safe when used short-term. Bismuth salts, including ranitidine bismuth citrate, colloidal bismuth subcitrate, and bismuth subnitrate appear to be safe when taken in doses of 400-2100 mg daily for up to 56 days.

Bismuth is possibly unsafe when used in larger amounts due to the risk for kidney failure, and when taken long-term due to the risk of nerve damage.","When taken by mouth: Bismuth subgallate and bismuth subsalicylate are likely safe for most people when used as directed.

Borage,"Borage is a plant. Its flowers and leaves, as well as the oil from its seeds are used as medicine.

Borage seed oil is used for skin disorders including eczema (atopic dermatitis), red, itchy rash on the scalp (seborrheic dermatitis), and a type of skin condition called neurodermatitis. It is also used for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), swelling of the gums, stress, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), diabetes, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), alcoholism, pain and swelling (inflammation), asthma, and for preventing heart disease and stroke. Borage oil is sometimes added to infant formula in small amounts to provide fatty acids needed to promote development of preterm infants.

Borage flower and leaves are used for fever, cough, and depression.

Borage is also used for a hormone problem called adrenal insufficiency, for ""blood purification,"" to increase urine flow, to prevent inflammation of the lungs, as a sedative, and to promote sweating. Borage is also used to increase breast milk production and to treat bronchitis and colds.

Borage is applied to the skin for red, itchy rash on the scalp of infants (seborrheic dermatitis) and is also used in a dressing to soften the skin.

In foods, borage is eaten in salads and soups.

In manufacturing, borage is used in skin care products.","Borage seed oil is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth or applied to the skin appropriately.

Borage seed oil is LIKELY UNSAFE when products containing a dangerous chemicals called pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are taken by mouth.

Children: Borage see oil is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth appropriately. Borage seed oil is LIKELY UNSAFE when products containing PA are taken by mouth.

Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Borage seed oil is LIKELY UNSAFE during pregnancy and while breast-feeding. It is important to avoid borage products that might contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs). PAs are a risk to the mother because they can cause serious liver disease and might cause cancer. PAs are also a risk to the infant because they might cause birth defects and they can pass into breast milk. Researchers are not sure if borage products that are certified PA-free are safe during pregnancy and breast-feeding. It is best to stay safe and avoid using borage.

Bleeding disorders: There is some concern that borage seed oil might prolong bleeding time and increase the risk of bruising and bleeding. If you have a bleeding disorder, use borage with caution.

Liver disease: Borage products containing hepatotoxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PA) might make liver disease worse.

Surgery: Borage might increase the risk of bleeding during and after surgery. Stop taking borage at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","The following doses have been studied in scientific research:

ADULTS
BY MOUTH:
For rheumatoid arthritis (RA): 4.5-7.2 grams of borage seed oil daily for up to 24 weeks.
CHILDREN

Boron,"Boron is an element. Boron has been consumed for menstrual cramps and boric acid has been used vaginally for yeast infections, but evidence is limited.

Boron seems to affect the way the body handles other minerals such as calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus. It also seems to increase estrogen levels post-menopause. Boric acid, a common form of boron, can kill yeast that cause vaginal infections. Boron may have antioxidant effects.

People commonly use boron for boron deficiency and vaginal yeast infections. It is also used for athletic performance, menstrual cramps, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses.","When taken by mouth: Boron is likely safe when used in doses that don't exceed 20 mg daily. Boron is possibly unsafe when taken in higher doses. Doses over 20 mg daily might cause male fertility problems. Large doses can also cause poisoning. Signs of poisoning include irritability, tremors, weakness, headaches, diarrhea, vomiting, and other symptoms.

When applied to the skin: Sodium pentaborate pentahydrate gel, which contains boron, is likely safe when applied to the skin for up to 5 weeks.

When applied into the vagina: Boric acid, a common form of boron, is likely safe when used for up to 6 months. It can cause vaginal burning.","When taken by mouth: Boron is likely safe when used in doses that don't exceed 20 mg daily. Boron is possibly unsafe when taken in higher doses.

For those 19-50 years old, do not take more than 20 mg daily; for those 14-18 years old, do not take more than 17 mg daily. Taking boron by mouth in higher doses is possibly unsafe and has been linked to lower birth weights and birth defects. Applying boric acid into the vagina during the first 4 months of pregnancy has also been linked to birth defects.

Children: Boron is likely safe when used appropriately. The amount that is safe depends on the child's age. Boron is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth in higher doses. Large quantities of boron can cause poisoning. Boric acid powder, a common form of boron, is possibly unsafe when applied in large amounts to prevent diaper rash.

Hormone-sensitive condition such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids: Boron might act like estrogen. If you have any condition that might be made worse by estrogen, avoid supplemental boron or high amounts of boron from foods.

Kidney disease: Do not take boron supplements if you have kidney problems. The kidneys have to work hard to flush out boron.","Boron is naturally found in water and foods such as nuts and vegetables. There aren't any specific dietary recommendations for boron, but it's estimated that most adults consume about 1-1.5 mg daily.

In supplements, adults shouldn't consume more than 20 mg daily. For children, the amount that is safe depends on age. Speak with a healthcare provider to find out what dose might be best for a specific condition."

Calcium,"Calcium is an essential nutrient found in many foods, such as dairy products. The bones and teeth contain over 99% of all calcium in the human body.

Bones are always breaking down and rebuilding. Calcium is needed for this process, but the concentration of calcium in the body tends to decline with age. Taking extra calcium helps the bones rebuild and stay strong. The heart, nerves, and blood-clotting systems also need calcium.

People commonly take calcium by mouth for the treatment and prevention of low calcium levels, muscle cramps, osteoporosis, softening of the bones, and PMS. It is also used for high blood pressure, cancer, stroke, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these other uses.

In the US and Canada, foods that contain calcium and vitamin D are allowed to state that they might reduce the risk of osteoporosis.","When taken by mouth: Calcium is likely safe when used in recommended amounts of about 1000-1200 mg daily. Calcium can cause some minor side effects such as belching or gas. But calcium is possibly unsafe when taken in doses above the daily tolerable upper intake level (UL). The UL is 2500 mg for adults ages 19-50 years and 2000 mg for adults over 50 years. Taking more than this daily can increase the chance of having serious side effects.

It is also used for nausea, vomiting, migraine, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using cannabis for COVID-19.

Don't confuse cannabis with hemp. Hemp contains very low levels of THC, less than 0.3% according to legal standards. Both hemp and cannabis also contain cannabinoids such as CBD, cannabidivarin (CBDV), cannabigerol (CBG), and others. Unlike hemp, cannabis is illegal under federal law in the US. It is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. But some states have legalized or decriminalized recreational use.","When taken by mouth: Cannabis is possibly unsafe when used in large amounts or long-term. Edible cannabis containing 50 mg or more of THC has been linked with serious side effects. Regularly taking large amounts of cannabis might cause cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS). CHS leads to severe nausea and vomiting that doesn't respond to typical anti-nausea drugs. Also, using cannabis for at least 1-2 weeks can cause dependence.

When sprayed into the mouth: A specific cannabis extract (Sativex) is possibly safe. This is a prescription-only product in the UK and Canada. It is not approved in the US.

When inhaled: Cannabis is possibly unsafe when used in large amounts or long-term. Smoking or vaping cannabis can cause breathing problems and is linked with increased risk of heart attack and stroke. Vaping products containing THC have been linked to serious lung injury. Regularly smoking cannabis may cause CHS and/or dependence.","When taken by mouth: Cannabis is possibly unsafe when used in large amounts or long-term.

Pregnancy: Using cannabis is unsafe during pregnancy. Cannabis passes through the placenta and can slow the growth of the fetus and increase the risk for premature birth, stillbirth, childhood leukemia, abnormalities, or the need for intensive care after birth. It can also lead to lower intelligence and emotional problems in the child when they grow up. It also increases the risk for anemia and high blood pressure while pregnant.

Breast-feeding: Using cannabis is likely unsafe while breast-feeding. The chemicals in cannabis pass into breastmilk and stay in breastmilk for longer than 6 weeks, even after cannabis use has been stopped. These chemicals might slow down the development of the baby. Avoid all cannabis use if planning to breastfeed.

Bipolar disorder: Using cannabis might make manic symptoms worse in people with bipolar disorder.

Heart disease: Cannabis might cause fast heartbeat and high blood pressure. It might also increase the risk of having heart attack.

Allergies to fruits and vegetables: Cannabis might increase the risk of an allergic reaction in people with allergies to foods like tomatoes, bananas, and citrus fruit.

Depression: Using cannabis might increase the risk for depression. It can also worsen symptoms of depression and increase thoughts about suicide in those who already have depression.

Diabetes: Cannabis use might make it harder to control blood sugar levels. It might also increase the risk for long-term complications from diabetes. Until more is known, be cautious using cannabis.

Epilepsy: High doses of cannabis might cause seizures in people with epilepsy. There have been several reports where high doses of cannabis have caused seizures.

Weakened immune system: Because cannabis can be contaminated with fungus, there's some concern that using cannabis might put people with weakened immune systems at risk for fungal infections.

Liver disease: It is unclear if cannabis worsens chronic liver disease. Until more is known, be cautious using cannabis.

Lung diseases: Cannabis can make lung problems worse. Regular use might increase the risk of lung cancer. Some people develop a type of lung disease called emphysema.

Irregular heartbeat: Cannabis might increase the risk for dangerous irregular heartbeat in people at high risk for these conditions.

Schizophrenia: Using cannabis might make symptoms of schizophrenia worse.

Quitting smoking: Using cannabis might make it harder to quit smoking.

Stroke: Using cannabis after having a stroke might increase the risk of having a second stroke.

Surgery: Cannabis affects the central nervous system. It might slow the central nervous system too much when combined with anesthesia and other medications during and after surgery. Stop using cannabis at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","Cannabis is commonly used in capsules, edible products, sprays, vape products, and cigarettes. Products can vary significantly depending on how much delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), and other cannabinoids they contain. Speak with a healthcare provider to find out what type of product and dose might be best for a specific condition.

Pregnancy: Cocoa is possibly safe when used in moderate amounts or in amounts commonly found in foods during pregnancy. But be sure to monitor your intake. Consuming cocoa in larger amounts is possibly unsafe because of the caffeine and heavy metals it contains. Caffeine found in cocoa crosses the placenta. High doses of caffeine during pregnancy might increase the risk for premature delivery, low birth weight, and miscarriage. Keep caffeine consumption below 300 mg per day during pregnancy. Chocolate products provide 2-35 mg caffeine per serving, and a cup of hot chocolate provides approximately 10 mg. So these products probably aren't a big concern. But unsweetened, dry cocoa powder can contain up to about 200 mg of caffeine per cup.

Breast-feeding: Cocoa is possibly safe when used in moderate amounts or in amounts commonly found in foods while breast-feeding. Consuming cocoa in larger amounts is possibly unsafe because of the caffeine and heavy metals it contains. Breast milk concentrations of caffeine are thought to be about half the level of caffeine in the breast-feeding parent. If too much chocolate (16 oz per day) is consumed when breast-feeding, the nursing infant may become irritable and have frequent bowel movements because of the caffeine.

Children: Dark chocolate products, which contain high amounts of cocoa, are possibly unsafe for children.

Coffee,"Coffee is a popular drink made from the roasted beans of Coffea fruits (Coffea arabica, Coffea canephora). It contains caffeine and chlorogenic acid.

The caffeine in coffee works by stimulating the central nervous system (CNS), heart, and muscles. Chlorogenic acid might affect blood vessels and how the body handles blood sugar and metabolism.

People most commonly drink coffee to increase mental alertness. Coffee is also used for diabetes, cancer, heart disease, high blood pressure, dementia, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.

Don't confuse coffee with other caffeine sources, such as green coffee, black tea, and green tea. These are not the same.","When taken by mouth: Coffee is commonly consumed as a beverage. Drinking coffee in moderate amounts (about 4 cups daily) is likely safe for most people.

Drinking more than 4 cups of coffee daily is possibly unsafe. Drinking large amounts might cause side effects due to the caffeine content. These side effects can range from mild to serious and include headache and irregular heartbeat.

When given as an enema (rectally): Coffee is possibly unsafe. Coffee enemas have been linked to cases of severe side effects, including death.","When taken by mouth: Coffee is commonly consumed as a beverage. Drinking coffee in moderate amounts (about 4 cups daily) is likely safe for most people.

Delta-8-Tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta-8-Thc),"Delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-8-THC) is a cannabinoid from Cannabis sativa. It's similar to delta-9-THC, the main psychoactive compound in cannabis.

Cannabinoids in cannabis work by binding to sites in the brain and on the nerves. Delta-8-THC is similar to delta-9-THC, but appears to be less psychoactive. The natural concentration of delta-8-THC in cannabis and hemp is low, so most delta-8-THC is synthetically made in a lab.

People use delta-8-THC for nausea and vomiting caused by cancer drug treatment, glaucoma, trouble sleeping, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.

Keep in mind that delta-8-THC hasn't been evaluated by the US FDA for safety, and legality isn't clear. It's banned in some states, and legal in others. Also, the amount of delta-8-THC in products might vary significantly. Some products might also contain contaminants.","When taken by mouth: There isn't enough reliable information to know if delta-8-THC is safe.

Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (Thc),"Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is a cannabinoid found in cannabis (Cannabis sativa). The psychoactive effects of cannabis are mainly due to THC.

There are over 80 cannabinoids in Cannabis sativa, but THC and cannabidiol (CBD) are the most well-studied. THC works by binding to specific sites in the brain and on the nerves. It's found in the highest levels in the leaves and flowers of the plant.

THC is commonly used as a recreational drug. People also use THC for multiple sclerosis (MS), nerve pain, nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy, alcohol use disorder, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using THC for COVID-19.

Don't confuse THC with other cannabinoids found in cannabis, including cannabichromene (CBC), cannabidiol (CBD), cannabidivarin (CBDV), cannabigerol (CBG), cannabinol (CBN), delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta-8-THC), or tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV). Also don't confuse it with synthetic cannabinoids such as K2/Spice, or with plants containing THC, such as cannabis or hemp. These are not the same. THC is illegal on the federal level in the US. Due to its THC content, cannabis is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. But some states have legalized or decriminalized recreational use.","When taken by mouth: THC is possibly unsafe when used in large amounts or long-term. Edible cannabis containing 50 mg or more of THC has been linked with serious side effects. Regularly taking large amounts of THC might cause cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS). CHS leads to severe nausea and vomiting that doesn't respond to typical anti-nausea drugs. Also, using THC for at least 1-2 weeks can cause dependence.

Fish Oil,"Fish oil comes from many types of fish. It is rich in two important omega-3 fatty acids called eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).

The benefits of fish oil seem to come from its omega-3 fatty acid content. Fish that are especially rich in these oils include mackerel, herring, tuna, and salmon. The body doesn't produce many of its own omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids reduce pain and swelling, and also prevent the blood from clotting easily.

Some fish oil products are approved by the FDA as prescription medications to lower triglycerides levels. Fish oil is also available as a supplement. Fish oil supplements do not contain the same amount of fish oil as prescription products, so they cannot be used in place of prescription products. Fish oil supplements are sometimes used for heart health and mental health, but there is no strong evidence to support most of these uses.

Do not confuse fish oil with EPA, DHA, cod liver oil, flaxseed oil, krill oil, or shark liver oil. See the separate listings for these topics.","When taken by mouth: Fish oil is likely safe for most people in doses of 3 grams or less daily. Taking more than 3 grams daily might increase the chance of bleeding. Fish oil side effects include heartburn, loose stools, and nosebleeds. Taking fish oil supplements with meals or freezing them can reduce these issues.

Consuming high amounts of fish oil from DIETARY sources is possibly unsafe. Some fish are contaminated with mercury and other chemicals. Fish oil supplements typically do not contain these chemicals.

Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Fish oil supplements are likely safe when taken by mouth. Taking fish oil does not seem to affect the fetus during pregnancy or the baby while breast-feeding. But swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish should be avoided during pregnancy, by those who may become pregnant, and while breast-feeding. These fish might contain high levels of mercury and may contain other toxins. Limit consumption of other fish to 12 ounces/week (about 3 to 4 servings/week). Consuming fatty fish in high amounts is possibly unsafe.

Children: Fish oil supplements are possibly safe when taken by mouth. In adolescents, fish oil has been used safely in doses of up to about 2.2 grams daily for 12 weeks. But young children should not eat more than two ounces of fish per week. Consuming fish oil from DIETARY sources in large amounts is possibly unsafe. Fatty fish contain toxins such as mercury. Eating contaminated fish frequently can cause serious adverse effects in children.

Bipolar disorder: Taking fish oil might increase some of the symptoms of this condition.

Liver disease: Fish oil might increase the risk of bleeding in people with liver scarring due to liver disease.

Diabetes: Taking high doses of fish oil might make it more difficult to control blood sugar levels.

Familial adenomatous polyposis: There is some concern that fish oil might further increase the risk of getting cancer in people with this condition.

Conditions in which the immune system response is lowered (including HIV/AIDS): Higher doses of fish oil can lower the body's immune system response. This could be a problem for people whose immune system is already weak.

An implanted device to prevent irregular heartbeat: Fish oil might increase the risk of irregular heartbeat in patients with an implanted defibrillator. Stay on the safe side and avoid fish oil supplements.

Fish or seafood allergy: Some people who are allergic to seafood such as fish might also be allergic to fish oil supplements. There is no reliable information showing how likely people with seafood allergy are to have an allergic reaction to fish oil. Until more is known, advise patients allergic to seafood to avoid or use fish oil supplements cautiously.","Fish oil supplements have most often been used by adults in doses of up to 6 grams daily by mouth for up to 12 weeks. Fish oil products typically provide 180-465 mg of EPA and 120-375 mg of DHA per capsule. Fish oil is also available in prescription drugs, including Lovaza, Omtryg, and Epanova. Fish oil supplements cannot be used in place of fish oil prescription drugs. Speak with a healthcare provider to find out what product and dose might be best for a specific condition."
Flaxseed,"Flax (Linum usitatissimum) is a food and fiber crop. Flaxseeds are a good source of dietary fiber and omega-3 fatty acids, including alpha-linolenic acid.

Flaxseeds also contain phytoestrogens called lignans, which are similar to the hormone estrogen. The fiber in flaxseed is found in the seed coat. When taken before eating, it seems to make people feel less hungry. It might also help limit how much cholesterol the body absorbs from food.

Flaxseed is used for constipation, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, and swelling of the kidneys in people with lupus. It is also used for many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these other uses.

Flaxseed and flaxseed oil have different effects. For information about the oil, see Flaxseed Oil.","When taken by mouth: Flaxseed is likely safe for most adults. Adding flaxseed to the diet might increase the number of bowel movements each day. It might also cause side effects such as bloating, gas, stomachache, and nausea. Higher doses are likely to cause more side effects.

Flaxseed Oil,"Flaxseed oil comes from flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum). It is a good source of an essential omega-3 fatty acid called alpha-linolenic acid (ALA).

The alpha-linolenic acid and other chemicals in flaxseed oil seem to decrease swelling, which is why some people use it for conditions that involve inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritis.

Flaxseed oil is used for heart disease, high blood pressure, high levels of cholesterol or other fats (lipids) in the blood (hyperlipidemia), and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.

Flaxseed oil has different effects than whole or ground flaxseed. See Flaxseed for more information.","When taken by mouth: Flaxseed oil is likely safe for most adults. Supplements containing 2 grams of flaxseed oil daily have been used safely for up to 6 months. Higher doses of up to 24 grams daily have also been used safely for up to 7 weeks. These larger doses can cause side effects such as loose stools and diarrhea. Allergic reactions are also possible.

When applied to the skin: Flaxseed oil is possibly safe when used short-term. Flaxseed oil has been used safely on the wrist for up to 4 weeks.

Fluoride,"Fluoride is a form of the chemical element fluorine. It occurs naturally in nature and is found in body tissues containing calcium, such as bones and teeth.

Fluoride protects teeth from the bacteria in plaque. It also promotes new bone formation. This is different than most medicines used for weak bones (osteoporosis), which fight osteoporosis by keeping bone from being broken down.

People commonly use fluoride to prevent cavities, to reduce tooth plaque, and to reduce a mild form of gum disease (gingivitis). It is also used for Crohn disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.

The FDA warns that swallowing too much toothpaste can increase the risk for tooth staining. But this is likely more of a concern with long-term use rather than accidentally swallowing it just once. Also, starting June 2022, fluoride levels in bottled water cannot exceed 0.7 mg per liter and must be declared on the label.","When taken by mouth: Fluoride is commonly consumed in public drinking water. It is likely safe when consumed in doses below the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 10 mg of elemental fluoride daily. Taking high doses, long-term can weaken bones and ligaments, and cause muscle weakness and nervous system problems.

When applied to the teeth: Fluoride is likely safe when used in toothpastes and mouthwashes, and when applied by dentists.","When taken by mouth: Fluoride is commonly consumed in public drinking water.

It is likely safe when consumed in doses below the upper tolerable intake level of 10 mg daily and when applied directly to the teeth in toothpastes and mouthwashes while pregnant or breast-feeding. But using higher doses is possibly unsafe and can weaken bones and ligaments, and cause muscle weakness and nervous system problems.

Children: Fluoride is commonly consumed in public water supplies. It is likely safe when consumed in doses below the daily upper tolerable intake level. These doses are set by age: 0.7 mg for 0-6 months, 0.9 mg for 7-12 months, 1.3 mg for 1-3 years, 2.2 mg for 4-8 years, and 10 mg for children 8 years and older. It is also likely safe when applied directly to the teeth in toothpastes and mouthwashes. But consuming higher amounts of fluoride is possibly unsafe. Children under six should only use a pea-sized amount of fluoride-containing toothpaste, just in case they swallow some. For infants under 6 months of age, drinking water that is high in natural fluoride should not be mixed with infant formula.","In the US, most public water sources contain low amounts of added fluoride to prevent dental cavities. It is also sometimes added to bottled water. It's recommended that females 18 years and older consume 3 mg of fluoride daily. It's recommended that males 18 years of age consume 3 mg, and males 19 years and older consume 4 mg daily. Recommended amounts for children depend on age. Fluoride is also commonly used in toothpastes, mouthwashes, and other dental products. Speak with a healthcare provider to find out what dose or product might be best for a specific condition."
Fly Agaric Mushroom,"Fly agaric mushroom (Amanita muscaria) has a red cap with white spots. It is used as a hallucinogen but can be poisonous to humans.

Folic Acid,"Folate and folic acid are forms of vitamin B9 used for deficiency and to prevent pregnancy complications. Many foods contain folate or have folic acid added.

Since 1998, folic acid has been added to cold cereals, flour, breads, pasta, bakery items, cookies, and crackers, as required by federal law. Foods that are naturally high in folate include leafy vegetables, okra, asparagus, certain fruits, beans, yeast, mushrooms, animal liver and kidney, orange juice, and tomato juice. Folic acid is also available as a supplement, and is often used in combination with other B vitamins.

Folic acid is used for preventing and treating low blood levels of folate (folate deficiency) and high blood levels of homocysteine (hyperhomocysteinemia). People who are pregnant or might become pregnant take folic acid to prevent serious birth defects such as spina bifida. Folic acid is also used for many other conditions including depression, stroke, decline in memory and thinking skills, and many others.","When taken by mouth: It is likely safe for most people to take folic acid in doses of no more than 1 mg daily. Doses higher than 1 mg daily may be unsafe. These doses might cause stomach upset, nausea, diarrhea, irritability, confusion, behavior changes, skin reactions, seizures, and other side effects.

Another form of folic acid, L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (L-5-MTHF), can also be found in supplements. This type of folic acid is possibly safe for most people in doses up to about 400 mcg daily.

There is some concern that taking too much folic acid for a long time might cause serious side effects. Some research suggests that taking folic acid in doses of 0.8-1.2 mg daily might increase the risk for cancer or increase the risk of heart attack in people who have heart problems.","When taken by mouth: It is likely safe for most people to take folic acid in doses of no more than 1 mg daily.

Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Folic acid 300-400 mcg daily is recommended during pregnancy to prevent certain birth defects. The maximum recommended amount of folic acid during pregnancy or breastfeeding is 800 mcg daily for those under 18 years of age and 1000 mcg daily for those over 18 years of age. Do not use more unless directed by a healthcare professional.

Another form of folic acid, L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (L-5-MTHF), can also be found in supplements. This type of folic acid is possibly safe to take at a dose of up to 400 mcg daily when pregnant or breastfeeding.

Children: It is likely safe for children to take folic acid by mouth in the recommended amounts for their age. But children should avoid taking folic acid in doses that are higher than the daily upper limits. These limits are 300 mcg for 1-3 years of age, 400 mcg for 4-8 years of age, 600 mcg for 9-13 years of age, and 800 mcg for 14-18 years of age.

Another form of folic acid, L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (L-5-MTHF), can also be found in supplements. This type of folic acid is possibly safe in children.

Procedures to widen narrowed arteries (angioplasty): Using folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 might worsen narrowed arteries. Folic acid should not be used by people recovering from this procedure.

Cancer: Early research suggests that taking 0.8-1 mg of folic acid daily might increase the risk of cancer. Until more is known, people with a history of cancer should avoid high doses of folic acid.

Seizure disorder: Taking folic acid supplements, especially in high doses, might make seizures worse in people with seizure disorders.

Vitamin B12 deficiency: Taking folic acid supplements might improve certain lab tests in people with low vitamin B12 levels. This may make it seem like vitamin B12 deficiency is improved when it isn't. If left untreated, this could cause permanent nerve damage.","Folic acid is an important nutrient. The amount that should be consumed on a daily basis is called the recommended dietary allowance (RDA). The RDA for folic acid is provided as Dietary Folate Equivalents, or DFE. This is because the body absorbs the folic acid in supplements better than the folate found in food. 1 mcg DFE is the same as 1 mcg of folate found in food.

When coffee beans are roasted, they release water and the caffeine in the bean is more readily released when brewed. Unroasted (green) coffee beans release less caffeine when brewed. One cup of green coffee contains about 20-50 mg of caffeine, compared to about 100 mg in one cup of regular coffee."
Green Tea,"Green tea is made from the Camellia sinensis plant. Its dried leaves and leaf buds are used to make several different teas, including black and oolong teas.

Green tea is prepared by steaming and pan-frying the Camellia sinensis leaves and then drying them. Green tea is not fermented, so it's able to maintain important molecules called polyphenols, which seem to be responsible for many of its benefits. It also contains caffeine.

People commonly use a US FDA-approved prescription product containing green tea for genital warts. As a drink or supplement, green tea is sometimes used for high cholesterol, high blood pressure, to prevent heart disease, and to prevent ovarian cancer. It is also used for many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.","When taken by mouth: Green tea is commonly consumed as a beverage. Drinking green tea in moderate amounts (about 8 cups daily) is likely safe for most people. Green tea extract is possibly safe when taken for up to 2 years or when used as a mouthwash, short-term.

Clotting disorders: IP-6 might slow blood clotting. If you have a clotting disorder, use IP-6 with caution.

Iron-deficiency anemia: IP-6 binds with iron in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This reduces the amount of iron that the body absorbs from food and supplements.

Weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis): IP-6 binds with calcium in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This reduces the amount of calcium that the body absorbs from food and supplements. This might worsen osteoporosis.

Surgery: Since IP-6 might slow blood clotting, there is a concern that it might increase the risk of extra bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using IP-6 at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","The appropriate dose of IP-6 depends on several factors such as the user's age, health, and several other conditions. At this time there is not enough scientific information to determine an appropriate range of doses for IP-6.

Kava,"Kava is a beverage or extract made from the Piper methysticum plant. In the South Pacific, it's a popular drink that is used in ceremonies for relaxation.

The name ""kava"" comes from the Polynesian word ""awa,"" which means bitter. Kava affects the brain and other parts of the central nervous system. Chemicals called kavalactones that are found in kava are believed to be responsible for its effects.

People commonly use kava for anxiety. It's also used for stress, withdrawal from drugs called benzodiazepines, sleeping problems, and many other purposes, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses.

Cases of liver damage and even some deaths have been linked to kava use. Because of this, kava was taken off the market in Europe and Canada in the early 2000s. But after reviewing the evidence, most countries have allowed kava to return to the market. Kava was never taken off the market in the US.","When taken by mouth: Kava is possibly safe when taken for up to 6 months. Using kava can make it difficult to drive or operate machinery safely. Do not take kava before you plan on driving. ""Driving-under-the-influence"" citations have been issued to people driving erratically after drinking large amounts of kava tea.

People might have heard that using kava can cause liver damage. This seems to be rare and is most often linked to long-term use of very high doses. Most people who have used kava haven't experienced liver toxicity. Also, past cases of liver toxicity might not be due to kava. Other factors may have contributed to these toxic effects.","When taken by mouth: Kava is possibly safe when taken for up to 6 months.

The World Health Organization (WHO) lists khat as a drug that creates ""dependence"" in people, meaning it produces a continuing desire to keep using it. It is banned in countries like the US and Canada. However, it is legal in some European countries. Khat is used by many people from East Africa and Yemen.","When taken by mouth: Khat is POSSIBLY UNSAFE for most people. Although it isn't associated with physical addiction, it can cause psychological dependence. When people try to stop chewing khat, they may experience withdrawal. Withdrawal symptoms include irritation, nervousness, depression, loss of appetite, trembling, feeling hot, sleep problems, and nightmares.

Khat can also cause many side effects including mood changes, hyperactivity, aggressiveness, anxiety, depression, high blood pressure, manic behavior, paranoia, and psychosis. Trouble sleeping, loss of energy, and lack of concentration usually follow after use of khat. Severe side effects from khat include migraine, bleeding in the brain, heart attack, changes to blood vessels, lung problems, liver damage, and changes in sex drive and sexual performance.

Chewing khat leaves has led to infections that can cause problems such as pain below the ribs, changes in white blood cells, and an enlarged liver. This is probably from contamination of fresh, damp khat leaves.","When taken by mouth: Khat is POSSIBLY UNSAFE for most people.

L-arginine is converted in the body into a chemical called nitric oxide. Nitric oxide causes blood vessels to open wider for improved blood flow. L-arginine also stimulates the release of growth hormone, insulin, and other substances in the body. It can be made in a lab and used in supplements.

People use L-arginine for chest pain and various blow flow issues, erectile dysfunction, high blood pressure during pregnancy, and a serious disease in premature infants called necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). It's also used for many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these other uses.","When taken by mouth: L-arginine is possibly safe for most people when taken short-term. It can cause some side effects such as stomach pain, bloating, diarrhea, and low blood pressure.

Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency (GAMT): People with this inherited condition are unable to convert arginine and other similar chemicals into creatine. To prevent complications from this condition, avoid L-arginine supplements.

Recent heart attack: L-arginine might increase the risk of death after a heart attack, especially in older people. If you have had a heart attack recently, don't take L-arginine.

Kidney disease: L-arginine has caused high potassium levels when used by people with kidney disease. In some cases, this has resulted in a dangerous irregular heartbeat.

Surgery: L-arginine might interfere with blood pressure control during and after surgery. Stop taking L-arginine at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","L-arginine has most often been used by adults in doses that vary from 1.5 to 24 grams by mouth daily, for up to 18 months. It's also sometimes used in gels and creams. Speak with a healthcare provider to find out what type of product or dose might be best for a specific condition."
L-Carnitine,"L-carnitine is a chemical that is made in the human brain, liver, and kidneys. It helps the body turn fat into energy.

L-carnitine is important for heart and brain function, muscle movement, and many other body processes. The body can convert L-carnitine to other chemicals called acetyl-L-carnitine and propionyl-L-carnitine. But it's not clear whether the benefits of these other carnitines are the same.

L-carnitine is used to increase L-carnitine levels in people whose natural level of L-carnitine is too low. Some people also use L-carnitine for conditions of the heart and blood vessels, serious kidney disease, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.","When taken by mouth: L-carnitine is likely safe when taken for up to 12 months.

Lactiplantibacillus Plantarum,"Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) is a type of probiotic (""good"" bacteria) found in the mouth and gut. It's also found in fermented foods.

""Good"" bacteria such as L. plantarum can help break down food, absorb nutrients, and fight off ""bad"" organisms that might cause diseases. Specific strains of L. plantarum are commonly added to fermented foods like yogurt and are also found in probiotic supplements.

People use L. plantarum for eczema, high cholesterol, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a type of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis), and to prevent the common cold or other respiratory tract infections. It is also used for diarrhea, constipation, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these other uses. There is also no good evidence to support using L. plantarum for COVID-19.

Don't confuse L. plantarum with other probiotics, or with fermented food products such as fermented milk, kefir, or yogurt. These are not the same. Also note that L. plantarum used to be classified under the Lactobacillus genus. But Lactobacillus was split up into 25 different genera in April 2020. Some product labels might still list this species as Lactobacillus plantarum rather than its new name, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum.","When taken by mouth: Live L. plantarum is likely safe. It's been used safely together with other probiotics for up to 9 months. Some people might experience gas or bloating, but it's usually well-tolerated.

""Good"" bacteria such as L. brevis might help the body break down food, absorb nutrients, and fight off ""bad"" organisms that might cause diseases. These bacteria are sometimes added to fermented foods like yogurt and also found in dietary supplements.

People use L. brevis for alcohol-related liver disease, overgrowth of bacteria in the vagina (bacterial vaginosis), common cold, dry skin, gum disease, insomnia, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.

Don't confuse L. brevis with other probiotics, or with fermented food products such as fermented milk, kefir, or yogurt. These are not the same. Also note that L. brevis used to be classified under the Lactobacillus genus. But Lactobacillus was split up into 25 different genera in April 2020. Some product labels might still list this species as Lactobacillus brevis rather than its new name, Levilactobacillus brevis.","When taken by mouth: L. brevis is possibly safe for most people. L. brevis has been used safely in doses of up to 12 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for up to 3 months. It seems to be well-tolerated. But there isn't enough reliable information to know if heat-killed L. brevis is safe or what the side effects might be.

Weakened immune system: Probiotics have caused blood infections in a small number of people with weakened immune systems. If you have a weakened immune system, talk with your healthcare provider before taking probiotics, including L. brevis.

Damaged heart valves: Probiotic preparations can cause an infection in the inner lining of the heart chambers and heart valve. This is extremely rare, but people with damaged heart valves should stop taking probiotics, including L. brevis, before dental procedures or surgical procedures.","In adults, L. brevis has most often been taken by mouth alone or together with other probiotics in doses of 1-10 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 1-4 months. It's most often been applied to the vagina in doses of 4 billion CFUs daily for 6 months. It's also been used in gels and creams.

Licorice,"Licorice is an herb that grows in parts of Europe and Asia. Licorice root contains glycyrrhizin, which can cause side effects when eaten in large amounts.

The chemicals in licorice are thought to decrease swelling, decrease cough, and increase the chemicals in our body that heal ulcers. Many ""licorice"" products made in the U.S. actually don't contain licorice. They contain anise oil, which has the smell and taste of ""black licorice"".

Licorice is used for eczema, swelling of the liver, mouth sores, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using licorice for COVID-19.","When taken by mouth: Licorice is likely safe for most people when eaten in typical food amounts. Licorice that has had the chemical glycyrrhizin removed is possibly safe when taken in doses up to 4.5 grams daily for up to 4 months.

Licorice that contains glycyrrhizin is possibly unsafe when consumed in large amounts or for a long time. Eating licorice 5 grams or more daily for several weeks can cause severe side effects including heart attack. People who have heart disease, kidney disease, or high blood pressure are more sensitive to it. Ingesting large amounts of licorice from candy, lozenges, or tea might also cause serious side effects.

When applied to the skin: Applying gel with licorice root extract 2% is possibly safe for up to 2 weeks. It is possibly safe to use a licorice mouth rinse for up to one week.","When taken by mouth: Licorice is likely safe for most people when eaten in typical food amounts.

Pregnancy: It is unsafe to take licorice when pregnant. It might cause a miscarriage or early delivery. Eating about 250 grams of licorice per week seems to increase the risk of early delivery.

Breast-feeding: There isn't enough reliable information available about the safety of taking licorice when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.

Heart conditions: Licorice can cause the body to store water, and this can make heart failure worse. Licorice can also increase the risk of irregular heartbeat. Don't consume licorice if you have a heart condition.

Hormone-sensitive conditions such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids: Licorice might act like estrogen in the body. If you have any condition that might be made worse by exposure to estrogen, don't use licorice.

High blood pressure: Licorice can raise blood pressure. Don't consume large amounts of licorice if you have high blood pressure.

A muscle condition caused by nerve problems (hypertonia): Licorice can lower potassium levels in the blood. This can make hypertonia worse. Avoid licorice if you have hypertonia.

Low potassium levels in the blood (hypokalemia): Licorice can lower potassium levels in the blood. If your potassium is already low, licorice might make it too low. Don't use licorice if you have this condition.

Kidney disease: Consuming large amounts of licorice could make kidney disease worse.

Sexual problems: Consuming large amounts of licorice can lower interest in sex. It can also worsen erectile dysfunction (ED) by lowering levels of testosterone.

Surgery: Licorice might interfere with blood pressure control during and after surgery. Stop taking licorice at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","Licorice is available in many different types of products, including candies, lozenges, teas, chewing tobacco, creams, gels, patches, sprays, mouth washes, and others. Licorice extract has most often been used by adults in doses of 100-990 mg by mouth daily for 2-24 weeks.

Licorice naturally contains a chemical called glycyrrhizin. The amount of glycyrrhizin usually ranges from 1% to 12%. Most of the side effects from licorice are caused by this chemical. Licorice products that have had glycyrrhizin removed are sometimes called deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL).
Many ""licorice"" products manufactured in the U.S. actually don't contain any licorice. Instead, they contain anise oil, which has the smell and taste of ""black licorice""."

Magnesium,"Magnesium is a mineral that is important for normal bone structure in the body. People get magnesium from their diet, but sometimes magnesium supplements are needed if magnesium levels are too low. Low magnesium levels in the body have been linked to diseases such as osteoporosis, high blood pressure, clogged arteries, hereditary heart disease, diabetes, and stroke.

An easy way to remember foods that are good magnesium sources is to think of fiber. Foods that are high in fiber are generally high in magnesium. Dietary sources of magnesium include legumes, whole grains, vegetables (especially broccoli, squash, and green leafy vegetables), seeds, and nuts (especially almonds). Other sources include dairy products, meats, chocolate, and coffee. Water with a high mineral content, or ""hard"" water, is also a source of magnesium.

Magnesium is most commonly used for constipation, as an antacid for heartburn, for low magnesium levels, for pregnancy complications called pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, and for a certain type of irregular heartbeat (torsades de pointes).","When taken by mouth: Magnesium is LIKELY SAFE for most people when taken appropriately. Doses less than 350 mg daily are safe for most adults. In some people, magnesium might cause stomach upset, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and other side effects. When taken in very large amounts (greater than 350 mg daily), magnesium is POSSIBLY UNSAFE. Large doses might cause too much magnesium to build up in the body, causing serious side effects including an irregular heartbeat, low blood pressure, confusion, slowed breathing, coma, and death.

When given as a shot or by IV: Magnesium is LIKELY SAFE for most people when the prescription-only, injectable product is used correctly by a healthcare provider.","When taken by mouth: Magnesium is LIKELY SAFE for most people when taken appropriately.

When given as a shot or by IV: Magnesium is LIKELY SAFE for most people when the prescription-only, injectable product is used correctly by a healthcare provider.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Magnesium is LIKELY SAFE for those pregnant or breast-feeding when taken by mouth in doses less than 350 mg daily. Magnesium is POSSIBLY SAFE when the prescription-only, injectable product is given by IV or as a shot for up to 5 days before delivery. But prescription-only magnesium is given during pregnancy only for serious health conditions. There is evidence that using magnesium to suppress early labor might cause serious problems in the infant. Magnesium is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken by mouth in high doses or when the prescription-only, injectable product is given by IV or as a shot for longer than 5 days. Taking magnesium by mouth in high doses can cause diarrhea and too much magnesium in the blood. Receiving prescription-only magnesium by IV or as a shot for longer than 5 days might cause bone and brain problems in the infant.

Children: Magnesium is LIKELY SAFE for most children when taken by mouth appropriately or when the prescription-only, injectable product is used correctly. Magnesium is safe when taken by mouth in doses less than 65 mg for children 1-3 years, 110 mg for children 4-8 years, and 350 mg for children older than 8 years. Magnesium is LIKELY UNSAFE when taken by mouth in higher doses.

Alcoholism: Alcohol abuse increases the risk for magnesium deficiency.

Bleeding disorders: Magnesium seem to slow blood clotting. In theory, taking magnesium might increase the risk of bleeding or bruising in people with bleeding disorders.

Diabetes: Diabetes increases the risk for magnesium deficiency. Poorly controlled diabetes reduces how much magnesium the body absorbs.

Heart block: High doses of magnesium (typically delivered by IV) should not be given to people with heart block.

A condition called myasthenia gravis: Magnesium given intravenously (by IV) might worsen weakness and cause breathing difficulties in people with a condition called myasthenia gravis.

Kidney problems, such as kidney failure: Kidneys that don't work well have trouble clearing magnesium from the body. Taking extra magnesium can cause magnesium to build up to dangerous levels. Don't take magnesium if you have kidney problems.","The following doses have been studied in scientific research:

N-Acetyl Cysteine (Nac),"N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) comes from the amino acid L-cysteine. Amino acids are building blocks of proteins. NAC has many uses and is an FDA approved drug.

N-acetyl cysteine is an antioxidant that might play a role in preventing cancer. As a drug, it's used by healthcare providers to treat acetaminophen (Tylenol) poisoning. It works by binding the poisonous forms of acetaminophen that are formed in the liver.

People commonly use N-acetyl cysteine for cough and other lung conditions. It is also used for flu, dry eye, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using N-acetyl cysteine for COVID-19.

Although many dietary supplement products contain N-acetyl cysteine, the US FDA has stated that it's illegal for dietary supplements to contain N-acetyl cysteine since it's technically an approved drug. But as of August 2022, the FDA is considering changing this stance. It may allow for N-acetyl cysteine in dietary supplements as long as no safety issues come up. A final decision is pending. Prescription N-acetyl cysteine products are available under the guidance of a healthcare provider.","When taken by mouth: N-acetyl cysteine is likely safe for most adults.

Pregnancy: L-phenylalanine is commonly consumed in foods. But having too much phenylalanine during pregnancy can increase the chance of birth defects. For patients who process phenylalanine normally and have normal levels, it is fine to consume phenylalanine in typical food amounts, but supplements containing phenylalanine should be avoided. For pregnant patients who have high levels of phenylalanine, such as those with a condition called phenylketonuria (PKU), even normal food amounts are unsafe. For these patients, experts recommend a low phenylalanine diet for at least 20 weeks before getting pregnant. This should reduce the risk of birth defects.

Breast-feeding: L-phenylalanine is commonly consumed in foods. But there isn't enough reliable information to know if any form of phenylalanine is safe to use in larger amounts as medicine while breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.

Phenylketonuria (PKU) and other conditions that cause high levels of phenylalanine: Some people have inherited disorders, such as PKU, that cause their bodies to build up too much phenylalanine. This can cause developmental delay, high blood pressure, stroke, and many other serious health issues. If you have one of these disorders, avoid phenylalanine supplements.

Schizophrenia: Some people with schizophrenia have a movement disorder called tardive dyskinesia. Phenylalanine might make this movement disorder worse.","L-phenylalanine is an essential amino acid found in foods including meat, fish, eggs, cheese, and milk.

Giving a sodium phosphate enema to children OVER 2 years of age is likely safe when no more than one dose is given every 24 hours. But it is likely unsafe to give more than one dose every 24 hours, or to give a sodium phosphate enema to children who are under 2 years of age.

Gastrointestinal (GI) conditions:: Sodium phosphate can cause damage to the intestines in some people. If you have an obstruction or have an inflammatory GI condition, avoid using sodium phosphate.

High levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia):: Use phosphate salts cautiously if you have hypercalcemia. Too much phosphate could cause calcium to be deposited where it shouldn't be in your body.

High levels of phosphate in the blood: People with Addison's disease, severe heart and lung disease, kidney disease, thyroid problems, or liver disease are more likely to have too much phosphate in their blood when they take phosphate salts. Use phosphate salts only while under the care of a healthcare professional if you have one of these conditions.

Kidney disease: Use phosphate salts only while under the care of a healthcare professional if you have kidney problems.","Phosphate (as phosphorus) is found in many foods, including meat, fish, eggs, and dairy products. Phosphate deficiencies are rare. The amount that should be consumed on a daily basis is called the recommended dietary allowance (RDA). For adults, the RDA is 700 mg. While pregnant or breast-feeding, the RDA is 1250 mg for those 14-18 years of age and 700 mg for those over 18 years of age. In children, the RDA depends on age.

If you have one of these conditions, take water-soluble forms of vitamin A, called carotenoids, instead.

Iron deficiency: Iron deficiency might affect the body's ability to use vitamin A.

Liver disease: Too much vitamin A might make liver disease worse. Do not take vitamin A supplements if you have liver disease.

Malnutrition: In people with severe protein malnutrition, taking vitamin A supplements might result in having too much vitamin A in the body.

Zinc deficiency: Zinc deficiency might cause symptoms of vitamin A deficiency. Taking a combination of vitamin A and zinc supplements might be necessary to improve this condition.","Vitamin A is an important nutrient. It is found in many foods, including fruits, vegetables, eggs, whole milk, meat, and fish. The amount that should be consumed on a daily basis is called the recommended dietary allowance (RDA). The RDA is 900 mcg daily for males and 700 mcg daily for females. While pregnant, the RDA is 770 mcg daily. While breast-feeding, the RDA is 1300 mcg daily. In children, the RDA depends on age.

In supplements, vitamin A is available in two forms: pre-formed vitamin A (retinol or retinyl ester) and provitamin A (carotenoids). For products that contain both, only count the amount of pre-formed vitamin A to determine what is safe. Vitamin A is also available in many topical products, including creams, serums, and lotions. Speak with a healthcare provider to find out what type of product and dose might be best for a specific condition."
Vitamin B12,"Vitamin B12 is an essential vitamin found in foods such as meat, fish, and dairy. It can also be made in a lab and is often taken with other B vitamins.

Vitamin B12 is required for the function and development of many parts of the body, including the brain, nerves, and blood cells. Methylcobalamin is the active form of vitamin B12. Cyanocobalamin, which must be processed by the body into the active form, is the most common type used in supplements.

People commonly use vitamin B12 for vitamin B12 deficiency, cyanide poisoning, and high levels of homocysteine in the blood. It is also used for canker sores, cataracts, Alzheimer disease, osteoporosis, fatigue, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these other uses.","When taken by mouth: Vitamin B12 is likely safe for most people.

Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid),"Vitamin C is an essential vitamin that must be consumed in the diet. Good sources include fresh fruits and vegetables, especially citrus fruits.

Vitamin C is needed for the body to develop and function properly. It plays an important role in immune function. Most experts recommend getting vitamin C from the diet rather than taking supplements. Fresh oranges and fresh-squeezed orange juice are good sources.

Historically, vitamin C was used for preventing and treating scurvy. Today, people most commonly use vitamin C for preventing and treating the common cold. It's also used for autism, breast cancer, heart disease and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using vitamin C for COVID-19.","When taken by mouth: Vitamin C is likely safe for most people. In some people, vitamin C might cause side effects such as stomach cramps, nausea, heartburn, and headache. The chance of getting these side effects increases with higher doses. Taking more than 2000 mg daily is possibly unsafe and may cause kidney stones and severe diarrhea. In people who have had a kidney stone, taking amounts greater than 1000 mg daily increases the risk of getting more kidney stones.

Vitamin D,"Vitamin D is an essential vitamin that helps regulate calcium and phosphorus in the body. It also plays a role in maintaining proper bone structure.

There are different forms of vitamin D, including ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3). Vitamin D is found in fish, eggs, and fortified milk. It's also made in the skin when exposed to sunlight. During periods of sunlight, vitamin D is stored in fat and then released when sunlight is not available.

Vitamin D supplements are commonly used to treat and prevent vitamin D deficiency. People who don't get enough sun and people who are 65 years or older are at risk for deficiency. People also use vitamin D for weak and brittle bones, heart disease, asthma, hay fever, and many other conditions, but there's no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses. There is also no strong evidence to support using vitamin D supplements for COVID-19. But it is important to maintain healthy levels of vitamin D. This can be done by taking 400-1000 IU of vitamin D daily or spending 15-30 minutes in the sun each day.","When taken by mouth: Vitamin D is likely safe when taken in recommended amounts. Most people don't experience side effects with vitamin D, unless too much is taken. Some side effects of taking too much vitamin D include weakness, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, and others. Taking vitamin D for long periods of time in doses higher than 4000 IU (100 mcg) daily is possibly unsafe and may cause very high levels of calcium in the blood.","When taken by mouth: Vitamin D is likely safe when taken in recommended amounts.

Vitamin E,"Vitamin E is a vitamin that dissolves in fat. It is found in many foods including vegetable oils, cereals, meat, poultry, eggs, and fruits.

Vitamin E is an important vitamin required for the proper function of many organs in the body. It is also an antioxidant. Vitamin E that occurs naturally in foods (RRR-alpha-tocopherol) is different from man-made vitamin E that is in supplements (all-rac-alpha-tocopherol).

Vitamin E is used for treating vitamin E deficiency, which is rare, but can occur in people with certain genetic disorders and in very low-weight premature infants. Vitamin E is also used for many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these other uses.","When taken by mouth: Vitamin E is likely safe for most people when taken in doses lower than 1000 mg daily. This is the same as 1100 IU of synthetic vitamin E (all-rac-alpha-tocopherol) or 1500 IU of natural vitamin E (RRR-alpha-tocopherol). The risk of side effects increases with higher doses. Side effects can include nausea, fatigue, headache, and bleeding. Vitamin E is possibly unsafe when taken in doses greater than 1000 mg daily.

When applied to the skin: Vitamin E is likely safe for most people.

When inhaled: Vitamin E is possibly unsafe. Use of e-cigarettes and other vaping products containing vitamin E acetate has been linked to serious lung injury in some people.","Pregnancy: When used in the recommended daily amount, vitamin E is possibly safe during pregnancy. Do not take vitamin E supplements during the first 8 weeks of pregnancy without speaking with your healthcare provider. It might be harmful to the baby. Later in pregnancy, the maximum recommended amount of vitamin E is 800 mg in those 14-18 years of age and 1000 mg in those older than 18 years of age.

Breast-feeding: Vitamin E is likely safe when taken by mouth in recommended daily amounts. The maximum recommended amount of vitamin E while breast-feeding is 800 mg in those 14-18 years of age and 1000 mg in those older than 18 years of age. Vitamin E is possibly unsafe when taken in doses greater than the maximum recommended amount.

Children: Vitamin E is likely safe when taken by mouth appropriately. But children should avoid taking doses of vitamin E higher than the daily upper limits. These limits are 300 IU in children 1-3 years of age, 450 IU in children 4-8 years of age, 900 IU in children 9-13 years of age, and 1200 IU in children 14-18 years of age.

Bleeding disorders: Vitamin E might make bleeding disorders worse. If you have a bleeding disorder, avoid taking vitamin E supplements.

Heart disease: Vitamin E might increase the risk for death in people with a history of heart disease. People with a history of heart disease should avoid taking doses of vitamin E greater than 400 IU daily.

Diabetes: Vitamin E might increase the risk for heart failure in people with diabetes. People with diabetes should avoid taking doses of vitamin E greater than 400 IU daily.

Head and neck cancer: Vitamin E might increase the chance that this cancer will return. Do not take vitamin E supplements in doses greater than 400 IU daily.

Weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis): Exercise is sometimes used by people with osteoporosis to improve bone strength. Exercising and taking high doses of vitamin E and vitamin C might lessen the benefits of exercise on bone strength.

Prostate cancer: Vitamin E might increase the chance of developing prostate cancer. The effect of vitamin E in people who currently have prostate cancer isn't clear, but it might worsen the condition.

An inherited eye condition that causes poor night vision and loss of side vision (retinitis pigmentosa): All-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) 400 IU seems to speed vision loss in people with this condition. But much lower amounts (3 IU) don't seem to have this effect. If you have this condition, it is best to avoid vitamin E supplements.

Stroke: Vitamin E might increase the risk for death in some people with a history of stroke. People with a history of stroke should avoid taking doses of vitamin E greater than 400 IU daily.

Surgery: Vitamin E might increase the risk of bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using vitamin E supplements at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","Vitamin E is an important nutrient. Vegetable oils, cereals, meat, poultry, eggs, fruits, and wheat germ oil are good sources of vitamin E. The amount that should be consumed on a daily basis is called the recommended dietary allowance (RDA). The RDA for natural vitamin E (RRR-alpha-tocopherol) in adults is 15 mg (22 IU), 15 mg (22 IU) during pregnancy, and 19 mg (28 IU) when breastfeeding.

Keep in mind that the doses of natural vitamin E (RRR-alpha-tocopherol) and vitamin E that has been made in the lab (all-rac-alpha-tocopherol) are calculated differently. This can make supplement dosing confusing. The American Heart Association recommends obtaining vitamin E by eating a well-balanced diet rather than from supplements until more is known about the risks and benefits of these supplements."

Schizophrenia: The yohimbine in yohimbe might trigger psychosis in people with schizophrenia.

Surgery: Yohimbe might increase the risk for bleeding. People who take yohimbe should stop at least 2 weeks before surgery.","There isn't enough reliable information to know what an appropriate dose of yohimbe might be. Keep in mind that natural products are not always necessarily safe and dosages can be important. Also note that yohimbe supplement products have been found to commonly list inaccurate information on their product labels. Also, some yohimbe supplements list yohimbine hydrochloride as an active ingredient. Yohimbine hydrochloride is not legal to sell as a dietary supplement in the US."
Yucca,"Yucca is the common name for more than 40 species of plants in the Yucca genus. They have tough, sword-like leaves and a large spike of whitish flowers.

Yucca contains chemicals that might reduce swelling. It might also have antibacterial and antifungal effects.

People use yucca for osteoarthritis, high blood pressure, joint pain, migraine headache, diabetes, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.

Don't confuse yucca with cassava. These are not the same.","When taken by mouth: Yucca is commonly consumed in foods. But there isn't enough reliable information to know if yucca is safe or what the side effects might be when used in larger amounts as medicine.

Zeaxanthin,"Zeaxanthin is a type of organic pigment called a carotenoid. It's related to vitamin A and found in the human eye (macula and retina) along with lutein.

Zeaxanthin is thought to function as a light filter, protecting the eye tissues from sunlight damage. Foods rich in zeaxanthin include eggs, oranges, grapes, corn, goji berries, mango, orange pepper, and some other vegetables and fruits.

People use zeaxanthin for age-related vision loss. It's also used for eye strain, mental decline, heart disease, breast cancer, cataracts, and many other conditions, but there's no good scientific evidence to support these uses.",When taken by mouth: Zeaxanthin is likely safe when used in doses up to 2 mg daily. It is possibly safe when taken in larger doses. Doses up to 10 mg daily seem to be safe when used for up to 1 year.,"Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Zeaxanthin is commonly consumed in foods. There isn't enough reliable information to know if zeaxanthin is safe to use as medicine while pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and stick to food amounts.

Children: Zeaxanthin is possibly safe when taken by mouth in appropriate amounts. A specific product (LUTEINofta, SOOFT Italia SpA) containing zeaxanthin 0.0006 mg daily has been safely used in infants for 36 weeks.","Zeaxanthin is found in many foods, with orange pepper being the richest source. Other sources include egg yolks, corn, red grapes, oranges, honeydew melon, and mango.

Zeaxanthin is also taken in supplements, typically along with lutein. It's most often been used by adults in doses of 2 mg by mouth daily, for up to 4.8 years. Zeaxanthin is absorbed best when it's taken with a high-fat meal. Speak with a healthcare provider to find out what type of product or dose might be best for a specific condition."
Zedoary,"Zedoary is a plant. The underground stem (rhizome) is used to make medicine.

Traditional methods for preparing zedoary involve washing it with lots of water to remove most of the protein and water-soluble nutrients. The rinsing is also supposed to remove a poison that is yet to be identified.

Zedoary is used for stomach pain, loss of appetite, indigestion, as a mosquito repellant, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.","When taken by mouth: There isn't enough reliable information to know if zedoary is safe or what the side effects might be.

When applied to the skin: There isn't enough reliable information to know if zedoary is safe or what the side effects might be.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: It is LIKELY UNSAFE to take zedoary if you are pregnant. There is concern that it might cause a miscarriage.

It's also best to avoid zedoary if you are breast-feeding, since there isn't enough scientific information to know how it might affect a nursing infant.

Abnormally heavy bleeding during menstrual periods (menorrhagia): Some experts suggest that zedoary should not be used by women who have heavy menstrual periods.","The appropriate dose of zedoary depends on several factors such as the user's age, health, and several other conditions. At this time there is not enough scientific information to determine an appropriate range of doses for zedoary. Keep in mind that natural products are not always necessarily safe and dosages can be important. Be sure to follow relevant directions on product labels and consult your pharmacist or physician or other healthcare professional before using."
Zinc,"Zinc is an essential trace element commonly found in red meat, poultry, and fish. It is necessary in small amounts for human health, growth, and sense of taste.

Zinc is found throughout the body. The body doesn't store excess zinc, so it must be obtained from the diet. It's needed for immune function, wound healing, blood clotting, thyroid function, and much more. It also plays a key role in maintaining vision and might have effects against viruses.

People commonly use zinc for zinc deficiency, diarrhea, and Wilson disease. Zinc is also used for acne, diabetes, anorexia, burns, and many other purposes. There is some scientific evidence to support its use for some of these conditions. But for most, there is no good scientific evidence to support its use. There is also no good evidence to support using zinc for COVID-19.","When taken by mouth: Zinc is likely safe when used in amounts no greater than 40 mg daily. It is possibly safe when taken in larger doses, especially when used only for a short period of time. But taking doses higher than 40 mg daily might decrease how much copper the body absorbs. Taking very high doses of zinc is likely unsafe and might cause stomach pain, vomiting, and many other problems. Single doses of 10-30 grams of zinc can be fatal.

When applied to the skin: Zinc is likely safe. Using zinc on broken skin may cause burning, stinging, itching, and tingling.

When inhaled: Zinc is possibly unsafe when inhaled through the nose. It might cause permanent loss of smell. Avoid using nose sprays containing zinc.","When taken by mouth: Zinc is likely safe when used in amounts no greater than 40 mg daily.

When inhaled: Zinc is possibly unsafe when inhaled through the nose. It might cause permanent loss of smell. Avoid using nose sprays containing zinc.
Pregnancy: Zinc is likely safe when used in the recommended amounts while pregnant. But it is likely unsafe when used in high doses. Those over 18 should not take more than 40 mg of zinc daily, and those 14-18 years old should not take more than 34 mg daily while pregnant.

Breast-feeding: Zinc is likely safe when used in the recommended amounts while breast-feeding. But zinc is possibly unsafe when used in high doses. Those over 18 years old should not take more than 40 mg of zinc daily, and those 14-18 years old should not take more than 34 mg daily while breast-feeding.

Children: Zinc is likely safe when taken by mouth appropriately in recommended amounts. Daily doses of zinc should not exceed 4 mg daily in infants 0-6 months old, 5 mg daily in infants 7-12 months old, 7 mg daily in children 1-3 years old, 12 mg daily in children 4-8 years old, 23 mg daily in children 9-13 years old, and 34 mg daily in those 14-18 years old. In infants, it is possibly unsafe to apply topical zinc to broken skin. The zinc can be absorbed through the breaks in the skin and cause serious adverse effects.

Alcohol use disorder: Long-term, excessive alcohol use may reduce the body's ability to absorb zinc.

Surgery for weight-loss (bariatric surgery): Bariatric surgery reduces the absorption of zinc and might increase the risk for zinc deficiency. Zinc levels may need to be monitored.

Copper deficiency: Taking excess zinc can lead to copper deficiency. People with pre-existing copper deficiency or risk factors for copper deficiency such as malnutrition or gastrointestinal surgery may be at higher risk.

Kidney disease: Low intake of zinc in the diet might increase the risk of getting kidney disease. Also, people with kidney disease who are on hemodialysis are at risk for zinc deficiency and might require zinc supplements.

Vegetarianism: Vegetarian diets are often linked with lower zinc absorption. But the body adapts over time. It becomes better at absorbing zinc and reducing zinc loss.","Zinc is an essential nutrient found in foods such as red meat, poultry, and fish. The amount that should be consumed on a daily basis is called the recommended dietary allowance (RDA). For females 18 years of age the RDA is 9 mg, and for females 19 years and older the RDA is 8 mg. For males 18 years and older the RDA is 11 mg. While pregnant, the RDA is 13 mg in those 18 years of age and 11 mg in those 19 years and older. While breast-feeding, the RDA is 17 mg in those 18 years of age and 12 mg in those 19 years and older. In children, the RDA depends on age.

Zinc is also available in supplements, lotions, gels, ointments, mouth rinses, and many other products. Speak with a healthcare provider to find out what type of product and dose might be best for a specific condition."

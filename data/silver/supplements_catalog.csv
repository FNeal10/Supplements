Fish Oil,fish oil comes from many types of fish. it is rich in two important omega-3 fatty acids called eicosapentaenoic acid (epa) and docosahexaenoic acid (dha).  the benefits of fish oil seem to come from its omega-3 fatty acid content. fish that are especially rich in these oils include mackerel  herring  tuna  and salmon. the body doesn't produce many of its own omega-3 fatty acids. omega-3 fatty acids reduce pain and swelling  and also prevent the blood from clotting easily.  some fish oil products are approved by the fda as prescription medications to lower triglycerides levels. fish oil is also available as a supplement. fish oil supplements do not contain the same amount of fish oil as prescription products  so they cannot be used in place of prescription products. fish oil supplements are sometimes used for heart health and mental health  but there is no strong evidence to support most of these uses.  do not confuse fish oil with epa  dha  cod liver oil  flaxseed oil  krill oil  or shark liver oil. see the separate listings for these topics.,when taken by mouth: fish oil is likely safe for most people in doses of 3 grams or less daily. taking more than 3 grams daily might increase the chance of bleeding. fish oil side effects include heartburn  loose stools  and nosebleeds. taking fish oil supplements with meals or freezing them can reduce these issues.  consuming high amounts of fish oil from dietary sources is possibly unsafe. some fish are contaminated with mercury and other chemicals. fish oil supplements typically do not contain these chemicals.  when applied to the skin: there isn't enough reliable information to know if fish oil is safe or what the side effects might be.,when taken by mouth: fish oil is likely safe for most people in doses of 3 grams or less daily. taking more than 3 grams daily might increase the chance of bleeding. fish oil side effects include heartburn  loose stools  and nosebleeds. taking fish oil supplements with meals or freezing them can reduce these issues.  consuming high amounts of fish oil from dietary sources is possibly unsafe. some fish are contaminated with mercury and other chemicals. fish oil supplements typically do not contain these chemicals.  when applied to the skin: there isn't enough reliable information to know if fish oil is safe or what the side effects might be. pregnancy and breast-feeding: fish oil supplements are likely safe when taken by mouth. taking fish oil does not seem to affect the fetus during pregnancy or the baby while breast-feeding. but swordfish  king mackerel  and tilefish should be avoided during pregnancy  by those who may become pregnant  and while breast-feeding. these fish might contain high levels of mercury and may contain other toxins. limit consumption of other fish to 12 ounces/week (about 3 to 4 servings/week). consuming fatty fish in high amounts is possibly unsafe.  children: fish oil supplements are possibly safe when taken by mouth. in adolescents  fish oil has been used safely in doses of up to about 2.2 grams daily for 12 weeks. but young children should not eat more than two ounces of fish per week. consuming fish oil from dietary sources in large amounts is possibly unsafe. fatty fish contain toxins such as mercury. eating contaminated fish frequently can cause serious adverse effects in children.  bipolar disorder: taking fish oil might increase some of the symptoms of this condition.  liver disease: fish oil might increase the risk of bleeding in people with liver scarring due to liver disease.  diabetes: taking high doses of fish oil might make it more difficult to control blood sugar levels.  familial adenomatous polyposis: there is some concern that fish oil might further increase the risk of getting cancer in people with this condition.  conditions in which the immune system response is lowered (including hiv/aids): higher doses of fish oil can lower the body's immune system response. this could be a problem for people whose immune system is already weak.  an implanted device to prevent irregular heartbeat: fish oil might increase the risk of irregular heartbeat in patients with an implanted defibrillator. stay on the safe side and avoid fish oil supplements.  fish or seafood allergy: some people who are allergic to seafood such as fish might also be allergic to fish oil supplements. there is no reliable information showing how likely people with seafood allergy are to have an allergic reaction to fish oil. until more is known  advise patients allergic to seafood to avoid or use fish oil supplements cautiously.,fish oil supplements have most often been used by adults in doses of up to 6 grams daily by mouth for up to 12 weeks. fish oil products typically provide 180-465 mg of epa and 120-375 mg of dha per capsule. fish oil is also available in prescription drugs  including lovaza  omtryg  and epanova. fish oil supplements cannot be used in place of fish oil prescription drugs. speak with a healthcare provider to find out what product and dose might be best for a specific condition.
Flaxseed,flax (linum usitatissimum) is a food and fiber crop. flaxseeds are a good source of dietary fiber and omega-3 fatty acids  including alpha-linolenic acid.  flaxseeds also contain phytoestrogens called lignans  which are similar to the hormone estrogen. the fiber in flaxseed is found in the seed coat. when taken before eating  it seems to make people feel less hungry. it might also help limit how much cholesterol the body absorbs from food.  flaxseed is used for constipation  diabetes  high cholesterol  obesity  and swelling of the kidneys in people with lupus. it is also used for many other conditions  but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these other uses.  flaxseed and flaxseed oil have different effects. for information about the oil  see flaxseed oil.,when taken by mouth: flaxseed is likely safe for most adults. adding flaxseed to the diet might increase the number of bowel movements each day. it might also cause side effects such as bloating  gas  stomachache  and nausea. higher doses are likely to cause more side effects.  taking flaxseed extracts that contain lignans is possibly safe. flaxseed lignan extracts can be used safely for up to 6 months.  taking raw or unripe flaxseed by mouth is possibly unsafe. it might be poisonous.  when applied to the skin: flaxseed is possibly safe when used in a cloth on the skin.,when taken by mouth: flaxseed is likely safe for most adults. adding flaxseed to the diet might increase the number of bowel movements each day. it might also cause side effects such as bloating  gas  stomachache  and nausea. higher doses are likely to cause more side effects.  taking flaxseed extracts that contain lignans is possibly safe. flaxseed lignan extracts can be used safely for up to 6 months.  taking raw or unripe flaxseed by mouth is possibly unsafe. it might be poisonous.  when applied to the skin: flaxseed is possibly safe when used in a cloth on the skin. pregnancy: taking flaxseed by mouth during pregnancy is possibly unsafe. flaxseed can act like the hormone estrogen. some healthcare providers worry that this might harm the pregnancy. but there is no reliable clinical evidence about its effects on pregnancy. until more is known  stay on the safe side and avoid use.  breast-feeding: there isn't enough reliable information to know if flaxseed is safe to use when breast-feeding. stay on the safe side and avoid use.  hormone-sensitive cancers or conditions: because flaxseed might act somewhat like the hormone estrogen  it might make hormone-sensitive conditions worse. some of these conditions include breast and ovarian cancer. until more is known  avoid taking large amounts of flaxseed if you have one of these conditions.  high triglyceride levels (hypertriglyceridemia): partially defatted flaxseed  which contains less alpha linolenic acid content  might increase triglyceride levels. if your triglyceride levels are too high  don't take this type of flaxseed.  surgery: flaxseed might increase the risk of bleeding during and after surgery. stop using it at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.,flaxseed has most often been used by adults in doses of 20-30 grams by mouth daily. flaxseed is often mixed with foods and used in baked goods  such as muffins  breads  and snack bars. speak with a healthcare provider to find out what type of product and dose might be best for a specific condition.
Flaxseed Oil,flaxseed oil comes from flaxseed (linum usitatissimum). it is a good source of an essential omega-3 fatty acid called alpha-linolenic acid (ala).  the alpha-linolenic acid and other chemicals in flaxseed oil seem to decrease swelling  which is why some people use it for conditions that involve inflammation  such as rheumatoid arthritis.  flaxseed oil is used for heart disease  high blood pressure  high levels of cholesterol or other fats (lipids) in the blood (hyperlipidemia)  and many other conditions  but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.  flaxseed oil has different effects than whole or ground flaxseed. see flaxseed for more information.,when taken by mouth: flaxseed oil is likely safe for most adults. supplements containing 2 grams of flaxseed oil daily have been used safely for up to 6 months. higher doses of up to 24 grams daily have also been used safely for up to 7 weeks. these larger doses can cause side effects such as loose stools and diarrhea. allergic reactions are also possible.  when applied to the skin: flaxseed oil is possibly safe when used short-term. flaxseed oil has been used safely on the wrist for up to 4 weeks.  when applied into the eye: flaxseed oil is possibly safe when applied into the eye short-term. eye drops containing flaxseed oil have been used safely for up to 3 months. redness and itching may occur in some people. special precautions and warnings: pregnancy: flaxseed oil is possibly safe when taken by mouth in doses of up to 2 grams daily for up to 6 weeks during pregnancy. but using flaxseed oil during the second or third trimester has been linked with an increased risk of giving birth prematurely.  breast-feeding: there isn't enough reliable information to know if flaxseed oil is safe to use when breast-feeding. stay on the safe side and avoid use.  children: flaxseed oil is possibly safe for children when taken by mouth  short-term. flaxseed oil has been safely taken by mouth for up to 3 months by children about 7-8 years old.  surgery: flaxseed oil might increase the risk of bleeding during and after surgery. stop using it at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.,when taken by mouth: flaxseed oil is likely safe for most adults. supplements containing 2 grams of flaxseed oil daily have been used safely for up to 6 months. higher doses of up to 24 grams daily have also been used safely for up to 7 weeks. these larger doses can cause side effects such as loose stools and diarrhea. allergic reactions are also possible.  when applied to the skin: flaxseed oil is possibly safe when used short-term. flaxseed oil has been used safely on the wrist for up to 4 weeks.  when applied into the eye: flaxseed oil is possibly safe when applied into the eye short-term. eye drops containing flaxseed oil have been used safely for up to 3 months. redness and itching may occur in some people. special precautions and warnings: pregnancy: flaxseed oil is possibly safe when taken by mouth in doses of up to 2 grams daily for up to 6 weeks during pregnancy. but using flaxseed oil during the second or third trimester has been linked with an increased risk of giving birth prematurely.  breast-feeding: there isn't enough reliable information to know if flaxseed oil is safe to use when breast-feeding. stay on the safe side and avoid use.  children: flaxseed oil is possibly safe for children when taken by mouth  short-term. flaxseed oil has been safely taken by mouth for up to 3 months by children about 7-8 years old.  surgery: flaxseed oil might increase the risk of bleeding during and after surgery. stop using it at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.,flaxseed oil has most often been used by adults in doses of 1-2 grams by mouth daily for up to 6 months. speak with a healthcare provider to find out what dose might be best for a specific condition.
Fluoride,fluoride is a form of the chemical element fluorine. it occurs naturally in nature and is found in body tissues containing calcium  such as bones and teeth.  fluoride protects teeth from the bacteria in plaque. it also promotes new bone formation. this is different than most medicines used for weak bones (osteoporosis)  which fight osteoporosis by keeping bone from being broken down.  people commonly use fluoride to prevent cavities  to reduce tooth plaque  and to reduce a mild form of gum disease (gingivitis). it is also used for crohn disease  rheumatoid arthritis  and other conditions  but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.  the fda warns that swallowing too much toothpaste can increase the risk for tooth staining. but this is likely more of a concern with long-term use rather than accidentally swallowing it just once. also  starting june 2022  fluoride levels in bottled water cannot exceed 0.7 mg per liter and must be declared on the label.,when taken by mouth: fluoride is commonly consumed in public drinking water. it is likely safe when consumed in doses below the tolerable upper intake level (ul) of 10 mg of elemental fluoride daily. taking high doses  long-term can weaken bones and ligaments  and cause muscle weakness and nervous system problems.  when applied to the teeth: fluoride is likely safe when used in toothpastes and mouthwashes  and when applied by dentists.,when taken by mouth: fluoride is commonly consumed in public drinking water. it is likely safe when consumed in doses below the tolerable upper intake level (ul) of 10 mg of elemental fluoride daily. taking high doses  long-term can weaken bones and ligaments  and cause muscle weakness and nervous system problems.  when applied to the teeth: fluoride is likely safe when used in toothpastes and mouthwashes  and when applied by dentists.  pregnancy and breast-feeding: fluoride is commonly consumed in public drinking water. it is likely safe when consumed in doses below the upper tolerable intake level of 10 mg daily and when applied directly to the teeth in toothpastes and mouthwashes while pregnant or breast-feeding. but using higher doses is possibly unsafe and can weaken bones and ligaments  and cause muscle weakness and nervous system problems.  children: fluoride is commonly consumed in public water supplies. it is likely safe when consumed in doses below the daily upper tolerable intake level. these doses are set by age: 0.7 mg for 0-6 months  0.9 mg for 7-12 months  1.3 mg for 1-3 years  2.2 mg for 4-8 years  and 10 mg for children 8 years and older. it is also likely safe when applied directly to the teeth in toothpastes and mouthwashes. but consuming higher amounts of fluoride is possibly unsafe. children under six should only use a pea-sized amount of fluoride-containing toothpaste  just in case they swallow some. for infants under 6 months of age  drinking water that is high in natural fluoride should not be mixed with infant formula.,in the us  most public water sources contain low amounts of added fluoride to prevent dental cavities. it is also sometimes added to bottled water. it's recommended that females 18 years and older consume 3 mg of fluoride daily. it's recommended that males 18 years of age consume 3 mg  and males 19 years and older consume 4 mg daily. recommended amounts for children depend on age. fluoride is also commonly used in toothpastes  mouthwashes  and other dental products. speak with a healthcare provider to find out what dose or product might be best for a specific condition.
Fly Agaric Mushroom,fly agaric mushroom (amanita muscaria) has a red cap with white spots. it is used as a hallucinogen but can be poisonous to humans.  fly agaric mushrooms have chemicals that cause the brain to misunderstand what the body is seeing  hearing  tasting  and feeling.  despite serious safety concerns  fly agaric mushroom is sometimes used as a hallucinogen.,when taken by mouth: fly agaric mushroom is unsafe. it can cause side effects such as sleepiness  confusion  dizziness  delirium  and death.,when taken by mouth: fly agaric mushroom is unsafe. it can cause side effects such as sleepiness  confusion  dizziness  delirium  and death.  pregnancy and breast-feeding: fly agaric mushroom is unsafe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding.,there isn't enough reliable information to know what an appropriate dose of fly agaric mushroom might be. keep in mind that natural products are not always necessarily safe and dosages can be important. be sure to follow relevant directions on product labels and consult a healthcare professional before using.
Fo-Ti,fo-ti (polygonum multiflorum) is the root of a climbing plant native to east asia. it's one of the most popular herbs used in traditional chinese medicine.  fo-ti might affect levels of various chemicals in the body that are thought to have anti-aging effects. fo-ti might also increase the number of hair follicles and stimulate hair growth.  people use fo-ti for aging  decline in memory and thinking skills  hair loss  alzheimer disease  heart disease  and many other conditions  but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.  don't confuse fo-ti with knotweed or hu zhang. these are not the same.,when taken by mouth: fo-ti is possibly unsafe. fo-ti has been linked to several cases of liver damage.  when applied to the skin: there isn't enough information available to know if fo-ti is safe or what the side effects might be.,when taken by mouth: fo-ti is possibly unsafe. fo-ti has been linked to several cases of liver damage.  when applied to the skin: there isn't enough information available to know if fo-ti is safe or what the side effects might be. pregnancy: fo-ti is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth during pregnancy. fo-ti contains chemicals that can act like a strong laxative. the chemicals work by stimulating the intestine. bulk-forming laxatives are a safer choice in pregnancy. there isn't enough reliable information to know if fo-ti is safe to apply to the skin when pregnant. stay on the safe side and avoid use.  breast-feeding: fo-ti is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth while breast-feeding. chemicals in fo-ti can act like a laxative. these chemicals can pass into breast milk and cause diarrhea in the infant. there isn't enough reliable information to know if fo-ti is safe to apply to the skin when breast-feeding. stay on the safe side and avoid use.  children: fo-ti is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth by children. at least one case of liver damage has been linked with fo-ti use in a 5-year-old child.  hormone-sensitive conditions such as breast cancer  uterine cancer  ovarian cancer  endometriosis  or uterine fibroids: fo-ti extract might act like estrogen. if you have any condition that might be made worse by exposure to estrogen  don't use fo-ti.  liver disease: fo-ti has been linked to multiple cases of liver damage. fo-ti might make existing liver disease worse and may also increase the risk of bleeding in patients with liver disease.  surgery: fo-ti might affect blood sugar levels and slow blood clotting. this might interfere with blood sugar control and blood clotting during and after surgery. stop using fo-ti at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.,some fo-ti products use the raw root of the plant (sometimes called white fo-ti). other products use a processed form of the root (sometimes called red fo-ti). these products have different effects. there isn't enough reliable information to know what an appropriate dose of fo-ti might be. it might also be unsafe. speak with a healthcare provider before use.
Folic Acid,folate and folic acid are forms of vitamin b9 used for deficiency and to prevent pregnancy complications. many foods contain folate or have folic acid added.  since 1998  folic acid has been added to cold cereals  flour  breads  pasta  bakery items  cookies  and crackers  as required by federal law. foods that are naturally high in folate include leafy vegetables  okra  asparagus  certain fruits  beans  yeast  mushrooms  animal liver and kidney  orange juice  and tomato juice. folic acid is also available as a supplement  and is often used in combination with other b vitamins.  folic acid is used for preventing and treating low blood levels of folate (folate deficiency) and high blood levels of homocysteine (hyperhomocysteinemia). people who are pregnant or might become pregnant take folic acid to prevent serious birth defects such as spina bifida. folic acid is also used for many other conditions including depression  stroke  decline in memory and thinking skills  and many others.,when taken by mouth: it is likely safe for most people to take folic acid in doses of no more than 1 mg daily. doses higher than 1 mg daily may be unsafe. these doses might cause stomach upset  nausea  diarrhea  irritability  confusion  behavior changes  skin reactions  seizures  and other side effects.  another form of folic acid  l-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (l-5-mthf)  can also be found in supplements. this type of folic acid is possibly safe for most people in doses up to about 400 mcg daily.  there is some concern that taking too much folic acid for a long time might cause serious side effects. some research suggests that taking folic acid in doses of 0.8-1.2 mg daily might increase the risk for cancer or increase the risk of heart attack in people who have heart problems.,when taken by mouth: it is likely safe for most people to take folic acid in doses of no more than 1 mg daily. doses higher than 1 mg daily may be unsafe. these doses might cause stomach upset  nausea  diarrhea  irritability  confusion  behavior changes  skin reactions  seizures  and other side effects.  another form of folic acid  l-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (l-5-mthf)  can also be found in supplements. this type of folic acid is possibly safe for most people in doses up to about 400 mcg daily.  there is some concern that taking too much folic acid for a long time might cause serious side effects. some research suggests that taking folic acid in doses of 0.8-1.2 mg daily might increase the risk for cancer or increase the risk of heart attack in people who have heart problems. pregnancy and breast-feeding: folic acid 300-400 mcg daily is recommended during pregnancy to prevent certain birth defects. the maximum recommended amount of folic acid during pregnancy or breastfeeding is 800 mcg daily for those under 18 years of age and 1000 mcg daily for those over 18 years of age. do not use more unless directed by a healthcare professional.  another form of folic acid  l-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (l-5-mthf)  can also be found in supplements. this type of folic acid is possibly safe to take at a dose of up to 400 mcg daily when pregnant or breastfeeding.  children: it is likely safe for children to take folic acid by mouth in the recommended amounts for their age. but children should avoid taking folic acid in doses that are higher than the daily upper limits. these limits are 300 mcg for 1-3 years of age  400 mcg for 4-8 years of age  600 mcg for 9-13 years of age  and 800 mcg for 14-18 years of age.  another form of folic acid  l-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (l-5-mthf)  can also be found in supplements. this type of folic acid is possibly safe in children.  procedures to widen narrowed arteries (angioplasty): using folic acid  vitamin b6  and vitamin b12 might worsen narrowed arteries. folic acid should not be used by people recovering from this procedure.  cancer: early research suggests that taking 0.8-1 mg of folic acid daily might increase the risk of cancer. until more is known  people with a history of cancer should avoid high doses of folic acid.  seizure disorder: taking folic acid supplements  especially in high doses  might make seizures worse in people with seizure disorders.  vitamin b12 deficiency: taking folic acid supplements might improve certain lab tests in people with low vitamin b12 levels. this may make it seem like vitamin b12 deficiency is improved when it isn't. if left untreated  this could cause permanent nerve damage.,folic acid is an important nutrient. the amount that should be consumed on a daily basis is called the recommended dietary allowance (rda). the rda for folic acid is provided as dietary folate equivalents  or dfe. this is because the body absorbs the folic acid

Magnesium,"magnesium is a mineral that is important for normal bone structure in the body. people get magnesium from their diet  but sometimes magnesium supplements are needed if magnesium levels are too low. low magnesium levels in the body have been linked to diseases such as osteoporosis  high blood pressure  clogged arteries  hereditary heart disease  diabetes  and stroke.  an easy way to remember foods that are good magnesium sources is to think of fiber. foods that are high in fiber are generally high in magnesium. dietary sources of magnesium include legumes  whole grains  vegetables (especially broccoli  squash  and green leafy vegetables)  seeds  and nuts (especially almonds). other sources include dairy products  meats  chocolate  and coffee. water with a high mineral content  or ""hard"" water  is also a source of magnesium.  magnesium is most commonly used for constipation  as an antacid for heartburn  for low magnesium levels  for pregnancy complications called pre-eclampsia and eclampsia  and for a certain type of irregular heartbeat (torsades de pointes).",when taken by mouth: magnesium is likely safe for most people when taken appropriately. doses less than 350 mg daily are safe for most adults. in some people  magnesium might cause stomach upset  nausea  vomiting  diarrhea  and other side effects. when taken in very large amounts (greater than 350 mg daily)  magnesium is possibly unsafe. large doses might cause too much magnesium to build up in the body  causing serious side effects including an irregular heartbeat  low blood pressure  confusion  slowed breathing  coma  and death.  when given as a shot or by iv: magnesium is likely safe for most people when the prescription-only  injectable product is used correctly by a healthcare provider.,when taken by mouth: magnesium is likely safe for most people when taken appropriately. doses less than 350 mg daily are safe for most adults. in some people  magnesium might cause stomach upset  nausea  vomiting  diarrhea  and other side effects. when taken in very large amounts (greater than 350 mg daily)  magnesium is possibly unsafe. large doses might cause too much magnesium to build up in the body  causing serious side effects including an irregular heartbeat  low blood pressure  confusion  slowed breathing  coma  and death.  when given as a shot or by iv: magnesium is likely safe for most people when the prescription-only  injectable product is used correctly by a healthcare provider. pregnancy and breast-feeding: magnesium is likely safe for those pregnant or breast-feeding when taken by mouth in doses less than 350 mg daily. magnesium is possibly safe when the prescription-only  injectable product is given by iv or as a shot for up to 5 days before delivery. but prescription-only magnesium is given during pregnancy only for serious health conditions. there is evidence that using magnesium to suppress early labor might cause serious problems in the infant. magnesium is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth in high doses or when the prescription-only  injectable product is given by iv or as a shot for longer than 5 days. taking magnesium by mouth in high doses can cause diarrhea and too much magnesium in the blood. receiving prescription-only magnesium by iv or as a shot for longer than 5 days might cause bone and brain problems in the infant.  children: magnesium is likely safe for most children when taken by mouth appropriately or when the prescription-only  injectable product is used correctly. magnesium is safe when taken by mouth in doses less than 65 mg for children 1-3 years  110 mg for children 4-8 years  and 350 mg for children older than 8 years. magnesium is likely unsafe when taken by mouth in higher doses.  alcoholism: alcohol abuse increases the risk for magnesium deficiency.  bleeding disorders: magnesium seem to slow blood clotting. in theory  taking magnesium might increase the risk of bleeding or bruising in people with bleeding disorders.  diabetes: diabetes increases the risk for magnesium deficiency. poorly controlled diabetes reduces how much magnesium the body absorbs.  heart block: high doses of magnesium (typically delivered by iv) should not be given to people with heart block.  a condition called myasthenia gravis: magnesium given intravenously (by iv) might worsen weakness and cause breathing difficulties in people with a condition called myasthenia gravis.  kidney problems  such as kidney failure: kidneys that don't work well have trouble clearing magnesium from the body. taking extra magnesium can cause magnesium to build up to dangerous levels. don't take magnesium if you have kidney problems.,the following doses have been studied in scientific research:  adults by mouth: general: the daily recommended dietary allowances (rda) for elemental magnesium are: 19-30 years  400 mg (men) and 310 mg (women); 31 years and older  420 mg (men) and 320 mg (women). for pregnancy: age 14-18 years  the rda is 400 mg; 19-30 years  350 mg; 31-50 years  360 mg. for lactation: age 14-18 years  the rda is 360 mg; 19-30 years  310 mg; 31-50 years  320 mg. the daily upper intake level (ul) for magnesium is 350 mg for anyone over 8 years old  including those that are pregnant and breast-feeding. for constipation: 8.75-25 grams of magnesium citrate has been used  usually

Vitamin E,vitamin e is a vitamin that dissolves in fat. it is found in many foods including vegetable oils  cereals  meat  poultry  eggs  and fruits.  vitamin e is an important vitamin required for the proper function of many organs in the body. it is also an antioxidant. vitamin e that occurs naturally in foods (rrr-alpha-tocopherol) is different from man-made vitamin e that is in supplements (all-rac-alpha-tocopherol).  vitamin e is used for treating vitamin e deficiency  which is rare  but can occur in people with certain genetic disorders and in very low-weight premature infants. vitamin e is also used for many other conditions  but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these other uses.,when taken by mouth: vitamin e is likely safe for most people when taken in doses lower than 1000 mg daily. this is the same as 1100 iu of synthetic vitamin e (all-rac-alpha-tocopherol) or 1500 iu of natural vitamin e (rrr-alpha-tocopherol). the risk of side effects increases with higher doses. side effects can include nausea  fatigue  headache  and bleeding. vitamin e is possibly unsafe when taken in doses greater than 1000 mg daily.  when applied to the skin: vitamin e is likely safe for most people.  when inhaled: vitamin e is possibly unsafe. use of e-cigarettes and other vaping products containing vitamin e acetate has been linked to serious lung injury in some people.,pregnancy: when used in the recommended daily amount  vitamin e is possibly safe during pregnancy. do not take vitamin e supplements during the first 8 weeks of pregnancy without speaking with your healthcare provider. it might be harmful to the baby. later in pregnancy  the maximum recommended amount of vitamin e is 800 mg in those 14-18 years of age and 1000 mg in those older than 18 years of age.  breast-feeding: vitamin e is likely safe when taken by mouth in recommended daily amounts. the maximum recommended amount of vitamin e while breast-feeding is 800 mg in those 14-18 years of age and 1000 mg in those older than 18 years of age. vitamin e is possibly unsafe when taken in doses greater than the maximum recommended amount.  children: vitamin e is likely safe when taken by mouth appropriately. but children should avoid taking doses of vitamin e higher than the daily upper limits. these limits are 300 iu in children 1-3 years of age  450 iu in children 4-8 years of age  900 iu in children 9-13 years of age  and 1200 iu in children 14-18 years of age.  bleeding disorders: vitamin e might make bleeding disorders worse. if you have a bleeding disorder  avoid taking vitamin e supplements.  heart disease: vitamin e might increase the risk for death in people with a history of heart disease. people with a history of heart disease should avoid taking doses of vitamin e greater than 400 iu daily.  diabetes: vitamin e might increase the risk for heart failure in people with diabetes. people with diabetes should avoid taking doses of vitamin e greater than 400 iu daily.  head and neck cancer: vitamin e might increase the chance that this cancer will return. do not take vitamin e supplements in doses greater than 400 iu daily.  weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis): exercise is sometimes used by people with osteoporosis to improve bone strength. exercising and taking high doses of vitamin e and vitamin c might lessen the benefits of exercise on bone strength.  prostate cancer: vitamin e might increase the chance of developing prostate cancer. the effect of vitamin e in people who currently have prostate cancer isn't clear  but it might worsen the condition.  an inherited eye condition that causes poor night vision and loss of side vision (retinitis pigmentosa): all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin e) 400 iu seems to speed vision loss in people with this condition. but much lower amounts (3 iu) don't seem to have this effect. if you have this condition  it is best to avoid vitamin e supplements.  stroke: vitamin e might increase the risk for death in some people with a history of stroke. people with a history of stroke should avoid taking doses of vitamin e greater than 400 iu daily.  surgery: vitamin e might increase the risk of bleeding during and after surgery. stop using vitamin e supplements at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.,vitamin e is an important nutrient. vegetable oils  cereals  meat  poultry  eggs  fruits  and wheat germ oil are good sources of vitamin e. the amount that should be consumed on a daily basis is called the recommended dietary allowance (rda). the rda for natural vitamin e (rrr-alpha-tocopherol) in adults is 15 mg (22 iu)  15 mg (22 iu) during pregnancy  and 19 mg (28 iu) when breastfeeding.  keep in mind that the doses of natural vitamin e (rrr-alpha-tocopherol) and vitamin e that has been made in the lab (all-rac-alpha-tocopherol) are calculated differently. this can make supplement dosing confusing. the american heart association recommends obtaining vitamin e by eating a well-balanced diet rather than from supplements until more is known about the risks and benefits of these supplements.

Zinc,zinc is an essential trace element commonly found in red meat  poultry  and fish. it is necessary in small amounts for human health  growth  and sense of taste.  zinc is found throughout the body. the body doesn't store excess zinc  so it must be obtained from the diet. it's needed for immune function  wound healing  blood clotting  thyroid function  and much more. it also plays a key role in maintaining vision and might have effects against viruses.  people commonly use zinc for zinc deficiency  diarrhea  and wilson disease. zinc is also used for acne  diabetes  anorexia  burns  and many other purposes. there is some scientific evidence to support its use for some of these conditions. but for most  there is no good scientific evidence to support its use. there is also no good evidence to support using zinc for covid-19.,when taken by mouth: zinc is likely safe when used in amounts no greater than 40 mg daily. it is possibly safe when taken in larger doses  especially when used only for a short period of time. but taking doses higher than 40 mg daily might decrease how much copper the body absorbs. taking very high doses of zinc is likely unsafe and might cause stomach pain  vomiting  and many other problems. single doses of 10-30 grams of zinc can be fatal.  when applied to the skin: zinc is likely safe. using zinc on broken skin may cause burning  stinging  itching  and tingling.  when inhaled: zinc is possibly unsafe when inhaled through the nose. it might cause permanent loss of smell. avoid using nose sprays containing zinc.,when taken by mouth: zinc is likely safe when used in amounts no greater than 40 mg daily. it is possibly safe when taken in larger doses  especially when used only for a short period of time. but taking doses higher than 40

effects.  alcohol use disorder: long-term  excessive alcohol use may reduce the body's ability to absorb zinc.  surgery for weight-loss (bariatric surgery): bariatric surgery reduces the absorption of zinc and might increase the risk for zinc deficiency. zinc levels may need to be monitored.  copper deficiency: taking excess zinc can lead to copper deficiency. people with pre-existing copper deficiency or risk factors for copper deficiency such as malnutrition or gastrointestinal surgery may be at higher risk.  kidney disease: low intake of zinc in the diet might increase the risk of getting kidney disease. also  people with kidney disease who are on hemodialysis are at risk for zinc deficiency and might require zinc supplements.  vegetarianism: vegetarian diets are often linked with lower zinc absorption. but the body adapts over time. it becomes better at absorbing zinc and reducing zinc loss.,zinc is an essential nutrient found in foods such as red meat  poultry  and fish. the amount that should be consumed on a daily basis is called the recommended dietary allowance (rda). for females 18 years of age the rda is 9 mg  and for females 19 years and older the rda is 8 mg. for males 18 years and older the rda is 11 mg. while pregnant  the rda is 13 mg in those 18 years of age and 11 mg in those 19 years and older. while breast-feeding  the rda is 17 mg in those 18 years
